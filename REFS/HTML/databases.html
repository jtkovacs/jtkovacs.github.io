   The first computerized information systems (IBM, c. 1950) imitated
   <strong>
    hierarchical
   </strong>
   paper filing systems. The more semantically powerful
   <strong>
    graph
   </strong>
   AKA network data model followed shortly thereafter (1960s, also IBM). In early systems, file and data formats were specific to an application or language; applications were specific to a department. This arrangement led to
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      redundancy:
     </em>
    </strong>
    the same data collected ($$) and stored ($$) by multiple departments;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      inconsistency:
     </em>
    </strong>
    redundant data that
    <em>
     should be the same
    </em>
    is not updated consistently;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      inaccessibility:
     </em>
    </strong>
    software developers were needed to write queries and integrate data across applications; no ad hoc queries or data processing.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Hierarchies and graphs were superseded by Edgar Codd's
   <strong>
    relational
   </strong>
   data model, proven in the 1970s and implemented in the 1980s. A relational database addresses the aforementioned problems because it is
   <strong>
    <em>
     centralized
    </em>
   </strong>
   (reducing redundancy, improving consistency, enabling data integration) and
   <strong>
    <em>
     abstracted
    </em>
   </strong>
   (available as a black box to interface with many different applications; offering an accessible language for ad hoc queries). It also:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Scales to terabytes with excellent performance for processing transactions
   </li>
   <li>
    Is platform-independent due to ANSI standards, allowing transfer of code across different products
   </li>
   <li>
    Is comparatively cheap to purchase and maintain, and widely available
   </li>
   <li>
    Provides a
    <a href="SQL.html">
     programming/query language
    </a>
    that is easy to learn and execute, expediting data retrieval
   </li>
   <li>
    Minimizes data redundancy, conserving storage and safeguarding data quality (although some redundancy is still required to establish relationships)

   databases introduced features like encapsulation and polymorphism c. 1990, but never became popular or standardized. With the advent of Big Data,
   <a href="#NoSQL-databases">
    NoSQL databases
   </a>
   (an umbrella term for non-relational database with SQL-like interface) have become popular because they beat relational DBs at quick search; however, relational databases are still better at maintaining data integrity (via transaction management with ACID properties).
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="ansi-sparc-architecture">
    ANSI-SPARC architecture
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is one way of thinking about database abstraction/separation, which, in general, makes the database easier to change and maintain by providing
   <strong>
    data independence:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    External views for different users (i.e., subsets and derivations of the data) are described by subschemas. Views are
    <strong>
     logically independent
    </strong>
    from the conceptual level.
   </li>
   <li>
    The structure of the entire database---all entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints---is described by a conceptual schema. This conceptual layer is
    <strong>
     physically independent
    </strong>
    from implementation details.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implementation details, including storage allocation, compression, and encryption, are described by an internal schema.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Then, the DBMS creates mappings (also called intensions; a realization of a schema is called the extension or state of the database) between schemas.

  <h3>
   <a name="the-relational-data-model">
    The relational data model
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In a relational database, the data model is of
   <strong>
    tables
   </strong>
   AKA relations. Tables have
   <strong>
    rows
   </strong>
   (AKA tuples, records) and
   <strong>
    columns
   </strong>
   (AKA attributes, fields). The order of rows and columns is insignificant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Representing reality in terms of entities, attributes and relationships occurs during the
   <a href="#conceptual-design">
    conceptual design phase
   </a>
   of database development. Per Ullman (2006),
   <strong>
    many different relational schemas could be used to model any given reality;
   </strong>
   the best designs will suit the underlying business processes and be
   <a href="#normalization">
    in a normal form.
   </a>
  </p>
  <h4>
   <a name="relationships-between-entities">
    Relationships between entities
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The relationship between two entites has several characteristics. The
   <strong>
    participation
   </strong>
   of a relationship is mandatory or optional; the
   <strong>
    cardinality
   </strong>
   AKA modality of a relationships may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many; see
   <a href="modeling.html#erds-for-databases">
    ERDs
   </a>
   for notation. A relationship is
   <strong>
    identifying
   </strong>
   if the PK of a parent entity appears in the PK of a child entity, denoted with a solid line; nonidentifying relationships are denoted with dashed lines.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="associative-entities">
    Associative entities
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Many-to-many relationships must be resolved with an associative entity (AKA junction table) that has a combined primary key (PK), both of which are foreign keys (FK). For example, consider a taxi company that owns cars; employs drivers; randomly assigns each driver a car for their shift; and wants to maintain a record for liability purposes. Entities CAR and DRIVER have a many-to-many relationship, since a driver will be assigned to multiple cars over the course of their employment and a car will likewise be driven by many different drivers. To capture the necessary data, SHIFTS is created as an associative entity with attributes driver ID, car ID, and shift date.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="superclasses-and-subclasses">
    Superclasses and subclasses
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Entities may be classified as superclasses and subclasses; this provides more semantic meaning to an ER model, makes the ER model more readable, and (depending on implementation) can reduce the number of NULLs in the database. There are several implementation options:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Subclass entity contains superclass PK along with its own unique attributes;
   </li>
   <li>
    Subclass entity contains all superclass attributes along with its own unique attributes;
   </li>
   <li>
    The ERD includes a superclass and subclass(es) but they are implemented as a single table.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
   <a name="types-of-attributes">
    Types of attributes
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Per Sunderraman (2012) and the Database Management Wikia (n.d.), an attribute is:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Composite
    </strong>
    if it can be decomposed into
    <strong>
     atomic
    </strong>
    attributes (which, per first normal form, it should be).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Derived
    </strong>
    if its value can be calculated from (an)other attribute(s) (which, per third normal form, it shouldn't be).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Multi-valued
    </strong>
    AKA set-valued if, for a single entity, the attribute could/should store multiple values (one-to-many relationship); in this case, the multi-valued attribute should be moved to a new table and linked back to the main entity via the entity's primary key.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
   <a name="relationships-between-attributes">
    Relationships between attributes
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Different sorts of relationships AKA dependencies exist between attributes; this is not a modeling decision, it is a feature of the real world. Dependencies are important for understanding
   <a href="#normalization">
    normalization;
   </a>
   normalization is a process of allocating attributes to entities to achieve a certain configuration of dependencies within each entity. Dependencies are also used (somehow?) in DB compression and query optimization.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="functional-dependencies-and-keys">
    Functional dependencies and keys
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   A functional dependency
   <code>
    A → B
   </code>
   exists when the same A (for our purposes, an attribute value called the
   <strong>
    determinant)
   </strong>
   is linked to a single B (another attribute value, called the
   <strong>
    dependent).
   </strong>
   The reverse is not necessarily true. Note that this is like a mathematical function, where each x, a function input, must correspond to exactly one y, a function output, but a single value of y might correspond to multiple different values of x:

   <thead>
    <tr class="header">

     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
   Written in predicate logic with tuples denoted t and u, attributes denoted A and B, a functional dependency exists if, for
   <code>
    ∀ t,u ∈ R, t.A = u.A ⇒ t.B = u.B
   </code>
   ; this generalizes to multiple attributes, such that a determinant is best (i.e., worst) defined as (an) attribute(s) whose value(s) determine(s) the value(s) of a second (set of) attribute(s). There are a few special cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Trivial:
    <code>
     A → B &amp; B ⊆ A
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    Nontrivial:
    <code>
     A → B &amp; B ⊈ A

   The set of attributes that are functionally dependent on a determinant is called the determinant's
   <strong>
    closure,
   </strong>
   <code>
    {A}*.
   </code>
   A closure can obviously be as small as a single attribute. Per displayName (2015), a determinant whose closure is the
   <em>
    entire table
   </em>
   is a
   <strong>
    candidate key
   </strong>
   AKA identity value; one candidate key is chosen as the table's sole
   <strong>
    primary key (PK).
   </strong>
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2718420/candidate-keys-from-functional-dependencie">
    This is an excellent demonstration of identifying (super) keys.
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, keys may be
   <strong>
    natural,
   </strong>
   i.e. present in the data, or
   <strong>
    synthetic
   </strong>
   AKA surrogate, automatically generated by the database for internal use. Keys may also be
   <strong>
    composite
   </strong>
   AKA concatenated, meaning that several attributes taken together (a set) are a determinant whose closure is the entire table. For primary keys specifically, they are most often an integer (the narrowest suitable field); immutable; and mandatory.

    Transitive dependencies
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   If a functional dependency exists between X and Y, and a functional dependency exists between Y and Z, then a transitive dependency exists between X and Z:
   <code>
    A → B &amp; B → C ⇒ A → C.
   </code>
   As an example, consider a table (perhaps in a bookstore database) with three attributes: ISBN, TITLE, AUTHOR, PHONE NUMBER. ISBN is the primary key; TITLE and AUTHOR are functionally dependent on it; but PHONE NUMBER is functionally dependent on AUTHOR, not on ISBN. Therefore a transitive dependency exists between PHONE NUMBER and ISBN.

   A multivalued dependency
   <code>
    A ↠ B

   exists if all tuples share their A attributes; tuple v shares B attributes with t, and its remaining attributes with u; tuple w shares A attributes with u, and its remaining attributes with t. In predicate logic:
   <code>
    if ∀ t,u∈R | t.A = u.A then ∃ v∈R | v.A=t.A and v.B=t.B and v.rest=u.rest.
   </code>
   Furthermore,
   <code>
    ∃ w∈R | w.A=t.A and w.B=u.B and w.rest=t.rest

    Integrity
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Data must have integrity to be useful and trustworthy. Data integrity
   <a href="wrangling.html#dirty-data-typologies">
    tends to erode,
   </a>
   and a database has mechanisms for maintaining it in its various forms:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Entity integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that entities in the real world are represented in each applicable table of the database by a single record (row). The constraint that rows be unique is enforced through the primary key.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Domain integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that attributes have meaningful (as in possible, if not necessarily accurate) values. This is enforced by column data types and custom domain restrictions.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Referential integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that, once one-to-many or many-to-many relationships are separated into different tables, the data is still kept in sync despite updates and deletions. Specifically, when a row is added to the latter table, its FK value should come from the former table’s PK or it should be NULL.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>
   <a name="normalization">
    Normalization
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Database schemas are normalized to minimize redundancy (limiting storage costs) and to
   <strong>
    preserve data integrity
   </strong>
   . Normalization is a process of allocating attributes to entities to achieve a certain configuration of
   <a href="#relationships-between-attributes">
    dependencies
   </a>
   within each entity. There are five but actually maybe six levels of normalization, with normalization to third normal form the msot frequent target. The first normal form is how Codd articulated his relational data model in the 1970s, with the other forms refining the basic relational model:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     1NF:
    </strong>
    Rows are unique, columns have a datatype, and all attributes are atomic. This means redundancy is minimized (versus trying to capture a many-to-many relationship in a single table).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     2NF:
    </strong>
    All columns in a table must be related via
    <a href="functional-dependencies-and-keys">
     FDs;
    </a>
    i.e., each column must be a determinant or a dependent.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     3NF:
    </strong>
    Remove
    <a href="#transitive-dependencies">
     TDs

    and derived attributes, preventing update and deletion anomalies*.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     BCNF:
    </strong>
    Extreme version of 3NF where, for all FDs
    <code>
     A → B,
    </code>
    A is the PK.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>

   "At the second normal form, [improvements] are still possible because a change to one row in a table may affect data that refers to this information from another table. For example, using the customer table just cited, removing a row describing a customer purchase (because of a return, perhaps) will also remove the fact that the product has a certain price. In the third normal form, these tables would be divided into two tables so that product pricing would be tracked separately.”

   A good design process minimizes redundancy; reduces errors by automating or imposing constraints on data entry; permits multiple analyses by replacing multipart fields with atomic ones; avoids data conflicts by reserving calculation to the analysis phase, rather than storing results; and ensures complete information by requiring it during input.
   <strong>
    Best practices for DB design:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clearly identify scope of database
   </li>
   <li>
    Follow a database design methodology, e.g. SDLC, Agile
   </li>
   <li>
    Use a professional data modeling tool, e.g. MS Visio
   </li>
   <li>
    Use a source control system, e.g. GitHub
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Note that databases are often developed in parallel with the applications that will use them. Also, DB development may use CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tools that help with standardization, integration, consistency, and automation. For databases, CASE tools may provide forward engineering (generating database-creating code based on ERD) and reverse engineering (generating ERD from existing database; an efficient way of producing documentation).

  <h2>
   <a name="design-phases">
    Design phases
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   All stages of design are beholden to the underlying data model. Conceptual design is broader, mostly focused on grouping attributes into tables; logical design is more granular, mostly focused on properties and constraints of each attribute. Lastly, physical design is focused on specifying the database and its interfaces, etc. according to a particular DBMS.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="conceptual-design">
    Conceptual design
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In the conceptual design stage of database development, there are two competing approaches:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     top-down approach
    </strong>
    (AKA design by decomposition) begins with identifying entities and relationships in the domain to be modeled, then filling in attributes. Entity relationship diagrams are often used. ERDs can be done in
    <a href="modeling.html#erds-for-databases">
     ER or UML notation;
    </a>
    MS Visio offers both.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     bottom-up approach
    </strong>
    begins with identifying attributes, then grouping them until entities and relationships emerge. Connolly and Begg (2015) suggest that a bottom-up approach is manageable only for smaller databases. For a larger, more complex database, a top-down approach may be necessary so that the database designer doesn’t get overwhelmed by numerous attributes.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Regardless, the end goal is a schema that is
   <a href="#normalization">
    normalized
   </a>
   to avoid anomalies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to constructing tables via a top-down or bottom-up approach, a conceptual design should:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Identify relationships verbally;
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify cardinality (max#) and optionality (min#) associated with each relationship;
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify entity subtypes/subclasses;
   </li>
   <li>
    Specify lookup tables;
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify
    <a href="#types-of-attributes">
     primary keys.
