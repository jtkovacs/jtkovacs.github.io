  <p>
   A

   is a either (1) collection of data that's structured according to a
   <strong>
    data model
   </strong>
   (usually relational, as

    discussed below;
   </a>
   see
   <a href="information-architecture.html#information-structures">
    notes on information structures

  </p>
  <p>
   A

   is either a
   <strong>
    database engine
   </strong>
   for interacting with the database plus a
   <strong>
    database frontend
   </strong>
   for user interaction, per definition (1) above; or these two things plus a database, per definition (2) above. A DMBS may be desktop-based (Access, FileMaker Pro) or server-based (SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL). See
   <a href="DBMS.html#core-functionality">

  <p>
   A
   <strong>
    database system
   </strong>
   is a database/DBMS plus database applications (any applications that source from or feed data to the database). This term denotes only the technical environment of a database; the full

   The first computerized information systems (IBM, c. 1950) imitated
   <strong>
    hierarchical
   </strong>
   paper filing systems. The more semantically powerful
   <strong>
    graph
   </strong>
   AKA network data model followed shortly thereafter (1960s, also IBM). In early systems, file and data formats were specific to an application or language; applications were specific to a department. This arrangement led to
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      redundancy:
     </em>
    </strong>
    the same data collected ($$) and stored ($$) by multiple departments;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      inconsistency:
     </em>
    </strong>
    redundant data that
    <em>
     should be the same
    </em>
    is not updated consistently;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      inaccessibility:
     </em>
    </strong>
    software developers were needed to write queries and integrate data across applications; no ad hoc queries or data processing.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Hierarchies and graphs were superseded by Edgar Codd's
   <strong>
    relational
   </strong>
   data model, proven in the 1970s and implemented in the 1980s. A relational database addresses the aforementioned problems because it is
   <strong>
    <em>
     centralized
    </em>
   </strong>
   (reducing redundancy, improving consistency, enabling data integration) and
   <strong>
    <em>
     abstracted
    </em>
   </strong>
   (available as a black box to interface with many different applications; offering an accessible language for ad hoc queries). It also:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Scales to terabytes with excellent performance for processing transactions
   </li>
   <li>
    Is platform-independent due to ANSI standards, allowing transfer of code across different products
   </li>
   <li>
    Is comparatively cheap to purchase and maintain, and widely available
   </li>
   <li>
    Provides a
    <a href="SQL.html">
     programming/query language
    </a>
    that is easy to learn and execute, expediting data retrieval
   </li>
   <li>
    Minimizes data redundancy, conserving storage and safeguarding data quality (although some redundancy is still required to establish relationships)
   </li>
   <li>
    Can capture complex relationships (important for enforcing business rules)
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="#integrity">

   databases introduced features like encapsulation and polymorphism c. 1990, but never became popular or standardized. With the advent of Big Data,
   <a href="#NoSQL-databases">
    NoSQL databases
   </a>
   (an umbrella term for non-relational database with SQL-like interface) have become popular because they beat relational DBs at quick search; however, relational databases are still better at maintaining data integrity (via transaction management with ACID properties).
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="ansi-sparc-architecture">
    ANSI-SPARC architecture
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is one way of thinking about database abstraction/separation, which, in general, makes the database easier to change and maintain by providing
   <strong>
    data independence:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    External views for different users (i.e., subsets and derivations of the data) are described by subschemas. Views are
    <strong>
     logically independent
    </strong>
    from the conceptual level.
   </li>
   <li>
    The structure of the entire database---all entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints---is described by a conceptual schema. This conceptual layer is
    <strong>
     physically independent
    </strong>
    from implementation details.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implementation details, including storage allocation, compression, and encryption, are described by an internal schema.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Then, the DBMS creates mappings (also called intensions; a realization of a schema is called the extension or state of the database) between schemas.

  <h3>
   <a name="the-relational-data-model">
    The relational data model
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In a relational database, the data model is of
   <strong>
    tables
   </strong>
   AKA relations, which can be clustered tables or heaps
   <a href="#indexing-and-performance">
    depending on their indexing.
   </a>
   Tables have
   <strong>
    rows
   </strong>
   (AKA tuples, records) and
   <strong>
    columns
   </strong>
   (AKA attributes, fields). The order of rows and columns is insignificant (unless an
   <a href="#indexing-and-performance">
    index
   </a>
   is created).
  </p>
  <p>
   Representing reality in terms of entities, attributes and relationships occurs during the
   <a href="#conceptual-design">
    conceptual design phase
   </a>
   of database development. Per Ullman (2006),
   <strong>
    many different relational schemas could be used to model any given reality;
   </strong>
   the best designs will suit the underlying business processes and be
   <a href="#normalization">
    in a normal form.
   </a>
  </p>
  <h4>
   <a name="relationships-between-entities">
    Relationships between entities
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   The relationship between two entites has several characteristics. The
   <strong>
    participation
   </strong>
   of a relationship is mandatory or optional; the
   <strong>
    cardinality
   </strong>
   AKA modality of a relationships may be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many; see
   <a href="modeling.html#erds-for-databases">
    ERDs
   </a>
   for notation. A relationship is
   <strong>
    identifying
   </strong>
   if the PK of a parent entity appears in the PK of a child entity, denoted with a solid line; nonidentifying relationships are denoted with dashed lines.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="associative-entities">
    Associative entities
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Many-to-many relationships must be resolved with an associative entity (AKA junction table) that has a combined primary key (PK), both of which are foreign keys (FK). For example, consider a taxi company that owns cars; employs drivers; randomly assigns each driver a car for their shift; and wants to maintain a record for liability purposes. Entities CAR and DRIVER have a many-to-many relationship, since a driver will be assigned to multiple cars over the course of their employment and a car will likewise be driven by many different drivers. To capture the necessary data, SHIFTS is created as an associative entity with attributes driver ID, car ID, and shift date.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="superclasses-and-subclasses">
    Superclasses and subclasses
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Entities may be classified as superclasses and subclasses; this provides more semantic meaning to an ER model, makes the ER model more readable, and (depending on implementation) can reduce the number of NULLs in the database. There are several implementation options:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Subclass entity contains superclass PK along with its own unique attributes;
   </li>
   <li>
    Subclass entity contains all superclass attributes along with its own unique attributes;
   </li>
   <li>
    The ERD includes a superclass and subclass(es) but they are implemented as a single table.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
   <a name="types-of-attributes">
    Types of attributes
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Per Sunderraman (2012) and the Database Management Wikia (n.d.), an attribute is:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Composite
    </strong>
    if it can be decomposed into
    <strong>
     atomic
    </strong>
    attributes (which, per first normal form, it should be).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Derived
    </strong>
    if its value can be calculated from (an)other attribute(s) (which, per third normal form, it shouldn't be).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Multi-valued
    </strong>
    AKA set-valued if, for a single entity, the attribute could/should store multiple values (one-to-many relationship); in this case, the multi-valued attribute should be moved to a new table and linked back to the main entity via the entity's primary key.

   A functional dependency
   <code>
    A → B
   </code>
   exists when the same A (for our purposes, an attribute value called the
   <strong>
    determinant)
   </strong>
   is linked to a single B (another attribute value, called the
   <strong>
    dependent).
   </strong>
   The reverse is not necessarily true. Note that this is like a mathematical function, where each x, a function input, must correspond to exactly one y, a function output, but a single value of y might correspond to multiple different values of x:

   Written in predicate logic with tuples denoted t and u, attributes denoted A and B, a functional dependency exists if, for
   <code>
    ∀ t,u ∈ R, t.A = u.A ⇒ t.B = u.B
   </code>
   ; this generalizes to multiple attributes, such that a determinant is best (i.e., worst) defined as (an) attribute(s) whose value(s) determine(s) the value(s) of a second (set of) attribute(s). There are a few special cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Trivial:
    <code>
     A → B &amp; B ⊆ A
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    Nontrivial:
    <code>
     A → B &amp; B ⊈ A
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    Completely nontrivial:
    <code>
     A → B &amp; A ∩ B = ∅
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    Technically transitive dependencies are functional dependencies
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The set of attributes that are functionally dependent on a determinant is called the determinant's
   <strong>
    closure,
   </strong>
   <code>
    {A}*.
   </code>
   A closure can obviously be as small as a single attribute. Per displayName (2015), a determinant whose closure is the
   <em>
    entire table
   </em>
   is a
   <strong>
    candidate key
   </strong>
   AKA identity value; one candidate key is chosen as the table's sole
   <strong>
    primary key (PK).
   </strong>
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2718420/candidate-keys-from-functional-dependencie">
    This is an excellent demonstration of identifying (super) keys.
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, keys may be
   <strong>
    natural,
   </strong>
   i.e. present in the data, or
   <strong>
    synthetic
   </strong>
   AKA surrogate, automatically generated by the database for internal use. Keys may also be
   <strong>
    composite
   </strong>
   AKA concatenated, meaning that several attributes taken together (a set) are a determinant whose closure is the entire table. For primary keys specifically, they are most often an integer (the narrowest suitable field); immutable; and mandatory.

  <p>
   If a functional dependency exists between X and Y, and a functional dependency exists between Y and Z, then a transitive dependency exists between X and Z:
   <code>
    A → B &amp; B → C ⇒ A → C.
   </code>
   As an example, consider a table (perhaps in a bookstore database) with three attributes: ISBN, TITLE, AUTHOR, PHONE NUMBER. ISBN is the primary key; TITLE and AUTHOR are functionally dependent on it; but PHONE NUMBER is functionally dependent on AUTHOR, not on ISBN. Therefore a transitive dependency exists between PHONE NUMBER and ISBN.

   Data must have integrity to be useful and trustworthy. Data integrity
   <a href="wrangling.html#dirty-data-typologies">
    tends to erode,
   </a>
   and a database has mechanisms for maintaining it in its various forms:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Entity integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that entities in the real world are represented in each applicable table of the database by a single record (row). The constraint that rows be unique is enforced through the primary key.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Domain integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that attributes have meaningful (as in possible, if not necessarily accurate) values. This is enforced by column data types and custom domain restrictions.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Referential integrity
    </strong>
    is the assurance that, once one-to-many or many-to-many relationships are separated into different tables, the data is still kept in sync despite updates and deletions. Specifically, when a row is added to the latter table, its FK value should come from the former table’s PK or it should be NULL.
   </li>
  </ul>

There are five but actually maybe six levels of normalization, with normalization to third normal form the most frequent target. The first normal form is how Codd articulated his relational data model in the 1970s, with the other forms progressive refinements of the basic relational model:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     1NF:

    All columns in a table must be related via

     FDs;
    </a>
    i.e., each column must be either a determinant or a dependent. This may require the creation of new entities to resolve one-to-many relationships through PK/FK pairs. If so, modification anomalies are prevented.

   <strong>
    Best practices for DB design:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clearly identify scope of database
   </li>
   <li>
    Follow a database design methodology, e.g. SDLC, Agile

   <li>
    Use a professional data modeling tool, e.g. MS Visio

   <li>
    Use a source control system, e.g. GitHub

  </ul>
  <p>
   Note that databases are often developed in parallel with the applications that will use them. Also, DB development may use CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tools that help with standardization, integration, consistency, and automation. For databases, CASE tools may provide forward engineering (generating database-creating code based on ERD) and reverse engineering (generating ERD from existing database; an efficient way of producing documentation).

   All stages of design are beholden to the underlying data model. Conceptual design is broader, mostly focused on grouping attributes into tables; logical design is more granular, mostly focused on properties and constraints of each attribute.

  <h3>
   <a name="conceptual-design">
    Conceptual design

  <p>
   In the conceptual design stage of database development, there are two competing approaches:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     top-down approach
    </strong>
    (AKA design by decomposition) begins with identifying entities and relationships in the domain to be modeled, then filling in attributes. Entity relationship diagrams are often used. ERDs can be done in
    <a href="modeling.html#erds-for-databases">
     ER or UML notation;
    </a>
    MS Visio offers both.
   </li>
   <li>
    The
    <strong>
     bottom-up approach
    </strong>
    begins with identifying attributes, then grouping them until entities and relationships emerge. Connolly and Begg (2015) suggest that a bottom-up approach is manageable only for smaller databases. For a larger, more complex database, a top-down approach may be necessary so that the database designer doesn’t get overwhelmed by numerous attributes.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Regardless, the end goal is a schema that is
   <a href="#normalization">

  <ul>
   <li>
    Identify relationships verbally;
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify cardinality (max#) and optionality (min#) associated with each relationship;

    Why to index

  </h5>
  <p>
   Various kinds of indexes are created to accelerate queries (retrieval of rows from pages) at the expense of write speed
   <code>
    (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations).
   </code>
   (Per Sheldon (2014), not
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   indexes improve performance for
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   queries; more complex queries that involve grouping and sorting can suffer from a clustered index.) Because of this read/write tradeoff, indexes are most useful in
   <a href="information-systems.html#what-are-mis?">
    reporting databases versus transactional databases.
   </a>
   Alternatively, an index may be erased when loading a very large dataset into the database, then subsequently restored.
  </p>
  <h5>
   <a name="what-to-index">
    What to index
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   The PK is indexed by default, and commonly searched fields may be indexed as well; many DBMS offer a
   <strong>
    query optimizer
   </strong>
   that identifies statistically when indexing would be beneficial. Often indexing a PK/FK pair will improve JOIN performance (and JOINs are very costly).

  <h5>
   <a name="how-different-types-of-indexes-work">
    How different types of indexes work
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   This discussion is based on MS SQL Server, which stores table data (rows) in uniformly-sized pages AKA blocks:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img src="../ILLOS/SQLDataPage.png"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   A table is either a
   <strong>
    heap
   </strong>
   or, if it has a clustered index, a
   <strong>
    clustered table.
   </strong>
   A heap is simply unsorted data pages; the order of its contents (i.e., how its rows are allocated across data pages) will be determined initially by data entry and then by DBMS-initiated changes (for efficiency's sake). A
   <strong>
    clustered index,
   </strong>
   on the other hand, introduces sorting that is implemented at the level of pages through row offset arrays AKA slot arrays; see Sheffield (2012). For this reason, there can be only one clustered index per table (PK by default).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, to facilitate specific queries, both heaps and clustered tables may have multiple
   <strong>
    non-clustered indexes
   </strong>
   that provide alternate sort orders "very much like the index at the end of a book: it occupies its own space, it is highly redundant, and it refers to the actual information stored in a different place" (Winand, n.d.).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    When a subset of rows are indexed, this is called a
    <strong>
     filtered index.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    When multiple fields are included in a single non-clustered index, this is called a
    <strong>
     covering index
    </strong>
    because it could "cover" all the fields retrieved in a stored query.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Just as heaps and clustered tables store their rows in data pages, non-clustered indexes store their
   <strong>
    leaf nodes
   </strong>
   in data pages. Via pointers,
   <a href="http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy/the-leaf-nodes">
    leaves are doubly connected
   </a>
   to each other (to maintain sort order as rows are added and deleted) and also refer to rows in the heap/clustered table (thereby making the index useful):
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img src="../ILLOS/nonclustered-index.png"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   For heap pages, clustered indexes, and non-clustered indexes alike, a
   <strong>
    B-tree
   </strong>
   AKA balance tree structure with
   <a href="http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/anatomy/the-tree">
    root and intermediary nodes
   </a>
   is used to make page search more efficient:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../ILLOS/B-tree.png" style="padding-top: 5px;" width="500px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, while heaps, clustered indexes, and non-clustered indexes use a rowstore structure (Sheldon, 2013), a
   <strong>
    columnstore index
   </strong>
   (useful for read-heavy databases with star or snowflake schemas, i.e. BI warehouses) searches only relevant columns:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img src="../ILLOS/columnstore.png"/>
  </div>
  <h5>
   <a name="fragmentation">
    Fragmentation
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Index fragmentation is inevitable, especially in OLTP environments:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    INSERT and UPDATE operations lead to page splits
    <strong>
     (logical fragmentation?)
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    DELETE operations lead to partially-filled pages
    <strong>
     (internal fragmentation)
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    Large rows
    <strong>
     (extent fragmentation?)
    </strong>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Fragmentation can be detected with a DBMS tool, then repaired:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clustered indexes:
    <ul>
     <li>
      &lt;1000 pages long or &lt;5% fragmentation, do nothing
     </li>
     <li>
      5% &lt; logical fragmentation &lt; 30%:
      <strong>
       reorganize
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      30% &lt; logical fragmentation:
      <strong>
       rebuild
      </strong>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Extent fragmentation of a heap table (non-indexed) can be reduced by creating then dropping a clustered index
   </li>
