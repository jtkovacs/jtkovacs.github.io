  <p>
   A

   </a>
   is either a
   <strong>
    database engine
   </strong>
   for interacting with the database plus a

  </h2>
  <p>
   The first computerized information systems (IBM, c. 1950) imitated
   <strong>
    hierarchical
   </strong>
   paper filing systems. The more semantically powerful
   <strong>
    graph
   </strong>
   AKA network data model followed shortly thereafter (1960s, also IBM). Both were superseded by Edgar Codd's
   <strong>
    relational
   </strong>
   data model, proven in the 1970s and implemented in the 1980s.
   <strong>
    Object
   </strong>
   databases introduced features like encapsulation and polymorphism c. 1990, but never became popular or standardized.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    NoSQL databases: broad umbrella term for technologies that produce a SQL-like UI for non-relational data, often Big Data. Better than relational DBs at quick search.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   avoids data redundancy → conserves storage and safeguards data quality. Better than NoSQL for maintaining data integrity because it implements transaction management with ACID properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   File and data formats were specific to an application or language; applications were specific to a department. This arrangement led to
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     redundancy:
    </strong>
    the same data collected and stored by multiple departments;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     inconsistency:
    </strong>
    redundant data that
    <em>
     should be
    </em>
    the same not updated consistently;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     inaccessibility:
    </strong>
    software developers were needed to write queries and integrate data across applications; no ad hoc queries or data processing.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   A database addresses the aforementioned problems because it is
   <strong>
    centralized
   </strong>
   (reducing redundancy, improving consistency, enabling data integration) and
   <strong>
    abstracted
   </strong>
   (available as a black box to interface with many different applications; offering an accessible language for ad hoc queries).
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="ansi-sparc-architecture">
    ANSI-SPARC architecture
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is one way of thinking about database abstraction/separation, which, in general, makes the database easier to change and maintain by providing
   <strong>
    data independence:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    External views for different users (i.e., subsets and derivations of the data) are described by subschemas. Views are
    <strong>
     logically independent
    </strong>
    from the conceptual level.
   </li>
   <li>
    The structure of the entire database---all entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints---is described by a conceptual schema. This conceptual layer is
    <strong>
     physically independent
    </strong>
    from implementation details.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implementation details, including storage allocation, compression, and encryption, are described by an internal schema.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Then, the DBMS creates mappings (also called intensions; a realization of a schema is called the extension or state of the database) between schemas.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <a name="the-relational-data-model">
    The relational data model
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In a relational database, the data model is of
   <strong>
    tables
   </strong>
   AKA relations. Tables have
   <strong>
    rows
   </strong>
   (AKA tuples, records) and
   <strong>
    columns
   </strong>
   (AKA attributes, fields). Columns have types, AKA d domains, which can be enumerated. Rules of relations: cells contain single values; columns store single type of data; column names are unique; order is insignificant; rows are unique (they need a key).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Relationship structure allows for scaling exceptionally large data sets with excellent performance for processing transactions: TRUE
   </li>
   <li>
    ANSI standards made platform-independence and transfer code across different products possible: TRUE
   </li>
   <li>
    Considered VERY expensive to purchase and maintain: FALSE
   </li>
   <li>
    Programming/query language that is easy to learn and execute: TRUE
   </li>
   <li>
    Difficult to retrieve data: FALSE
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What are the pros and cons of storing redundant data in a database?
  </p>
  <p>
   Redundant data has two major problems: first, the cost of physical storage, and second, the difficulties of keeping multiple copies of the same data consistent and accurate. For these reasons, normalization is used to minimize data redundancy (but not eliminate it, since the relational data model requires some redundancy to record relationships). However, because normalization is a complex process and because the cost of storage has declined over time, there may be cases or NoSQL database models where greater data redundancy is tolerated.

   An attribute is composite if its value can be decomposed. For example, an entity CAT may have an attribute OWNER NAME; this composite attribute could be decomposed into two atomic/simple attributes (OWNER FIRST NAME, OWNER LAST NAME).
  </p>
  <p>
   An attribute is multi-valued/set-valued if, for a single entity, the attribute could/should store multiple values. For example, a PERSON entity may have a LANGUAGES SPOKEN attribute that must contain multiple values to accommodate multilingual people.
  </p>
  <p>
   An attribute is derived if its value can be calculated from (an)other attribute(s) in the database. For example, the value of the attribute TRIP DURATION could be derived from the attributes DEPARTURE DATE and RETURN DATE.

   Explain what referential integrity is and how it is maintained within the Relational Data Model.
  </p>
  <p>
   One table’s primary key may be used in another table as a foreign key, establishing a relationship between the two tables; referential integrity means that the key is consistent across tables. Specifically, when a row is added to the latter table, its FK value should come from the former table’s PK or it should be NULL.

  <p>
   When two entities are related in many-to-many fashion, an associative entity must be created to resolve the relationship. For example, consider a taxi company that owns cars; employs drivers; randomly assigns each driver a car for their shift; and wants to maintain a record for liability purposes. Entities CAR and DRIVER have a many-to-many relationship, since a driver will be assigned to multiple cars over the course of their employment. To capture the necessary data, SHIFTS is created as an associative entity with attributes driver ID, car ID, and shift date.

  </h1>
  <p>
   A good design process prevents repetition; reduces errors (by limiting data entry through use of IDs, and imposing constraints); permits multiple analyses (by replacing multipart fields with atomic ones); avoids data conflicts (by reserving calculation to the analysis phase, rather than storing results); and ensures complete information (by requiring it during input).

  <ul>
   <li>
    Groundwork
   </li>
   <li>
    In the
    <strong>
     conceptual design stage,
    </strong>
    a database designer analyzes the business processes, documents, workflows, etc. that will be replaced or supported by the database. The goal is to understand thoroughly the business context of the database and to identify the entities (objects) and attributes (characteristics) it must contain.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the
    <strong>
     logical design stage,
    </strong>
    the entities and attributes are expressed in terms of the chosen data model (often relational). The goal is to express the data in a structured way that avoids data anomalies.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, in the
    <strong>
     physical design phase,
    </strong>
    the database designer produces software-specific instructions for implementing the database. The goal is to provide all the information necessary to build a database that takes advantage of features (like indexes) from the chosen platform.

  </p>
  <p>
   Business rules are database design constraints that arise from the business processes being modeled, not from requirements imposed by the relational data model (or other data model). Business rules affect the design of the database, including how entities are related; what attributes are collected; and what values are permitted or required for specific attributes. As an example, consider a database that stores donor and donations data for a nonprofit. Some business rules in this case might be that donors can make multiple donations, multiple donors can be associated with the same donation, and individual donation amounts must be over $10.

    Top-down vs. bottom-up design
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In the conceptual design stage of database development, there are two competing approaches: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach begins with identifying entities and relationships in the domain to be modeled, then filling in attributes. Entity relationship diagrams are often used. The bottom-up approach begins with identifying attributes, then grouping and normalizing them until entities and relationships emerge. Connolly and Begg (2015) suggest that a bottom-up approach is manageable only for smaller databases. For a larger, more complex database, a top-down approach may be necessary so that the database designer doesn’t get overwhelmed by numerous attributes.

  </p>
  <p>
   Design by decomposition avoids redundancy and its consequences (update &amp; deletion anomalies). First, specify “mega” relations and dependencies to capture real-world constraints on the data; then, decompose into better (i.e., normalized) relations.

   <strong>
    Functional dependency (FD)
   </strong>
   ,
   <code>
    A→B
   </code>
   : The same A is always linked with the same B, although the reverse is not necessarily true. In predicate logic, a FD exists if, for
   <code>
    ∀ t,u ∈ R, t.A = u.A ⇒ t.B = u.B
   </code>
   . This generalizes to multiple attributes:
   <code>
    A1, A2, …, An → B1, B2, …, Bm.
   </code>
   FDs are used in DB compression and query optimization.

    if every relation satisfying
    <code>
     S1
    </code>
    also satisfies

   </li>
   <li>
    <code>
     S2
    </code>
    , set of FDs, is equivalent to
    <code>

    if exactly the same FDs follow from
    <code>

    and

  </ul>
  <p>
   Describe what Transitive Dependency is and give an example.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a functional dependency exists between X and Y, and a functional dependency exists between Y and Z, then a transitive dependency exists between X and Z. Transitive dependencies create problems in relational databases so they are typically removed during normalization. As an example, consider a table (perhaps in a bookstore database) with three attributes: ISBN, TITLE, AUTHOR, PHONE NUMBER. ISBN is the primary key; TITLE and AUTHOR are functionally dependent on it; but PHONE NUMBER is functionally dependent on AUTHOR, not on ISBN. Therefore a transitive dependency exists between PHONE NUMBER and ISBN.

     Multivalued dependency
    </a>
   </strong>
   (MVD),
   <code>
    A↠B
   </code>
   : A multivalued dependency exists if all tuples share their A attributes; tuple v shares B attributes with t, and its remaining attributes with u; tuple w shares A attributes with u, and its remaining attributes with t. In predicate logic:
   <code>
    if ∀ t,u∈R | t.A = u.A then ∃ v∈R | v.A=t.A and v.B=t.B and v.rest=u.rest.

   <strong>
    Fourth normal form
   </strong>
   (4NF) is more restrictive than BCNF. Its whole point is to separate independent information (i.e., not functionally dependent information) to achieve efficiency: B+C rather than B*C tuples. A relation is in 4NF if, for each nontrivial MVD
   <code>
    A↠B
   </code>
   , A is the key. To test for 4NF, look at each pair of tuples
   <code>
    t,u
   </code>
   that match on A, and create the additional tuples
   <code>
    v,w
   </code>
   : are they both already in the relation? If not, MVD is not satisfied. To achieve 4NF, find FDs, MVDs and keys for R

   ; pick any R
