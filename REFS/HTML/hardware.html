   <strong>
    Bits
   </strong>
   , binary digits, are the 'atoms' of computerized information. Bits can be represented and transmitted by any two-state medium plus a consistent bits-per-unit-time clock (since states may be consecutive). The
   <em>
    bandwidth
   </em>
   of a system, its capacity to transmit information, is also called its
   <em>
    bitrate
   </em>
   .
   <em>
    Latency
   </em>
   is also important: that's the time it take for a bit to travel from receiver to sender.
  </p>
  <p>
   When bits flow between machines and the machines have
   <strong>
    protocols
   </strong>
   to interpret the bits, you have a
   <strong>
    network
   </strong>
   : devices that can communicate with each other. Most modern networks are packet-switched networks. Instead of sending a constant bitstream, devices on the network send packets of bits plus metadata. The
   <strong>
    router
   </strong>
   takes these packets and routes them efficiently but robustly to a destination device that reassembles the packets.
  </p>
  <p>

   The Internet is a network of networks with special protocols and entities. Internet means "interconnected networks". Internet is not WWW:
   <em>
    the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called Web servers [or HTTP servers]) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The Internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC. // The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, voice over IP telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.

    ISP

   is a company that manages some special routers that link all together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. [

    web server provides the Web---in the form of webpages and resources, clustered into websites with domain names---to a web client's browser. The browser renders web pages.
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop). The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP. Provided the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house). The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you (the goods arrive at your door — new stuff, awesome!).
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. "Hosting" means that all the webpages and their supporting files are available on that computer. The web server will send any webpage from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.

   ISPs can connect to each other as peers via
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_exchange_points_by_size">
    IXPs
   </a>
   or to upstream providers: Just as their customers pay them for Internet access, ISPs themselves pay upstream ISPs for Internet access. An upstream ISP usually has a larger network than the contracting ISP or is able to provide the contracting ISP with access to parts of the Internet the contracting ISP by itself has no access to (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider)
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the Internet Protocol (
   <strong>
    IPv4, IPv6
   </strong>
   ), all devices on the Internet have a unique IP address, and bits travel in IP packets (rather than directly from one machine to another). Routers receive these packets and---following transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP), or some other packet directing protocol---send them along different routes from sender to receiver, depending on traffic and outages. A router also take inventory of packets when they arrive and tells the sending server to resend any that were incomplete or missing. each packet carries the intended IP address, a number to determine where the packet fits back into the data sent, how many packets to expect, as well as your IP address
  </p>
  <p>
   The domain name system (
   <strong>
    DNS
   </strong>
   ) associates IP addresses with more human-friendly URLs. The DNS system consists of many DNS servers, connected to each other in a distributed hierarchy. DNS servers are sometimes spoofed: malicious IPs are associated with a domain that people might navigate to. Type URL into browser; DNS converts to IP?; browser talks to server located at IP ...:

      <code>
       &lt;host&gt; is &lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.&lt;second-level domain&gt;.&lt;top-level domain&gt; or &lt;IP address&gt;
      </code>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    in hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Browser-server communication consists of:
   </li>
   <li>
    GET requests from the browser, and web files (a combination of text, HTML, and CSS; or images, or videos) in response from the server.
   </li>
   <li>
    POST requests from the browser, sending information to the server
   </li>
   <li>
    COOKIES from the server to the browser and browser to the server; how the server remembers who you are
   </li>
   <li>
    Or, you might communicate with a server via the HTTPS protocol. The server offers a digital certificate that your browser verifies with a certification authority. Then, communication between you is protected by secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS).
