   order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is

   Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1)
   <strong>
    objective,
   </strong>
   with obvious empirical basis; (2)
   <strong>
    socially-negotiated,
   </strong>
   eventually becoming (3)
   <strong>
    culturally embedded;
   </strong>
   or (4)
   <strong>
    idiosyncratic:

  <p>
   IA is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports browsing/navigation and search of content objects (documents and metadata) stored in information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). The goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV).

  <p>
   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings. In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structure/systems (KOS); however, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:

  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, taxonomies/KOSs are very nearly synonymous with controlled vocabularies. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which are fraught with polysemes (both homographs and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms) that undermine information retrieval. A controlled vocabulary (the product) or vocabulary control (the process) improves information retrieval by:

    Tagging: saying what something is about in summary fashion, with keywords; also allows for grassroots view of what something’s about
