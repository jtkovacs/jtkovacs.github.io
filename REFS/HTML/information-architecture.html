    What is information architecture?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Information architecture (IA) is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports the search, browsing, and presentation of content objects (documents and metadata) within and across myriad different information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). Another way of putting this (credit to Rosenfeld, Morville, and Arango, 2015) is that IA aims to facilitate both the finding and understanding of information. For search (the concern of back-end IA), the goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV). For browsing (the concern of front-end IA), the goal is intuitive user interfaces and navigational structures.
  </p>

    Must information be organized?
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Abrahamson &amp; Freedman's
   <em>
    A perfect mess,
   </em>
   order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is
   <em>
    optimal.
   </em>
   At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn.
  </p>
  <p>
   Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, perhaps eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img alt="Objective, culturally embedded, socially negotiated, and idiosyncratic taxonomies" src="../ILLOS/taxonomy_status.png"/>
   <p class="caption">

  </h1>
  <p>
   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structures/systems (KOS). The field has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which existed even in antiquity as scrolls). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge asset management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond this general sense, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../ILLOS/KSOs.png" width="550px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Controlled vocabularies are very nearly synonymous with taxonomies. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which undermine information retrieval because they are fraught with polysemes (ambiguous words, both homographs/homophones and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms). Versus natural languages, CVs:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clearly define the SCOPE of terms using scope notes (SN) and history notes (HN);
   </li>
   <li>
    Provide some way of linking SYNONYMS, which increases recall;
   </li>
   <li>
    Distinguish between HOMOGRAPHS, which increases precision; and, optionally,
   </li>
   <li>
    Capture SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS between terms, which improves both recall and precision.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   <a name="basic-elements-of-controlled-vocabularies">
    Basic elements of controlled vocabularies
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   CVs consist of terms and relationships. Terms are chosen if warrant exists; this warrant may take a while to develop, leading to the category of candidate terms AKA provisional terms. Warrants have different bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    User warrant emerges from user search terms and feedback;
   </li>
   <li>
    Literary warrant emerges from review of documents and standards; and
   </li>
   <li>
    Organizational warrant emerges from an organization's existing standards.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Minimally, terms and relationship indicators must account for synonyms and homographs. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A preferred term must be designated among synonyms, and synonyms must be linked. This is often accomplished via the indicators UF (use for) and U (use), e.g. Salinity UF Saltiness, Saltiness U Salinity. Preferred terms are also called descriptors or headings; non-preferred terms are also called entry terms or lead-in terms.
   </li>
   <li>
    Homographs must be disambiguated with a modifier AKA difference AKA qualifier term, e.g. Mercury (metal), Mercury (planet), Mercury (car).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Terms may be compound, either bound (denoting a single concept) or consisting of a focus noun (also called head nous) plus a qualifier (in the case of homographs). Relationships between terms can be much more complex than U/UF; see
   <a href="#KOS-by-structure">

   Per ANSI/NISO Z39.19 (p. 16),
   <strong>
    recall
   </strong>
   is improved by indicating relationships:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Equivalence relationships/preferred terms
   </li>
   <li>
    Preferred term form

   <li>

  <p>
   <strong>
    Precision
   </strong>
   is improved by controlling ambiguity:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Parenthetical qualifiers

   <li>
    Broader and narrower term hierarchical relationships
   </li>
   <li>

   <li>
    Precoordination

  <p>
   As part of ingesting a content object to an information system, KOSs can be applied to the content object at several levels, creating more or less granular pictures of what the object is about.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    CATALOGING
   </strong>
   is the macro level, where a cataloger describes/represents a content object with metadata including subject headings and subheadings so it can be found and perhaps assigned to a single physical location (not a concern for digital objects). Cataloged objects are listed in a catalog. Subject headings and subheadings can be combined from the beginning (precoordination) or combined by users while searching (postcoordination); they may be organized in hierarchical (single parent), polyhierarchical (multi-parent), and faceted taxonomies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assigning subject headings is an act of
   <strong>
    CLASSIFYING
   </strong>
   objects, placing them into an existing classification scheme. "In LIS, the term 'classification' is used to refer to three distinct but related concepts: a system of classes, ordered according to a predetermined set of principles and used to organize a set of entities; a group or class in a classification system; and the process of assigning entities to classes in a classification system" (Jacob, 2004, p.522). The first sense of classification given here (constructing classes) may also be called
   <strong>
    CATEGORIZATION,
   </strong>
   although categories are perhaps less strict than classes. "Categorization is the process of dividing the world into groups of entities whose members are in some way similar to each ... By reducing the load on memory and facilitating the efficient storage and retrieval of information, categorization serves as the fundamental cognitive mechanism that simplifies the individual’s experience of the environment" (Jacob, 2004, p. 518).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    INDEXING
   </strong>
   is the micro level, where an indexer uses a controlled vocabulary (specifically, indexing terms from an indexing language) to map out the contents of a content object (what is discussed, and where it's discussed). For named entities, an authority file shuld be consulted. Indexing may be contrasted with
   <strong>
    TAGGING,
   </strong>
   where keywords are selected from the text itself rather than from an indexing language. This allows for a grassroots view of what something is about.

   <strong>
    REFERENCE WORKS
   </strong>
   here because the terminology often overlaps with KOSs as they interest IAs. Reference works are information-dense resources meant to be consulted for specific information, not read comprehensively. Definitions are quoted/paraphrased from Wikipedia:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Dictionary:
    </strong>
    (1) A collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically, which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, translation, etc. (2) A book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Lexicon:
    </strong>
    The ‘catalog’ of a language’s words, which together with a ‘grammar’ constitutes the language.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Encyclopedia:
    </strong>
    A type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Bibliography:
    </strong>
    Collected citations for related books, articles, etc., which may be as simple as a reading list or may be extensively annotated.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Thesaurus:
    </strong>
    A list of words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing synonyms and sometimes antonyms), in contrast to a dictionary, which provides definitions for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Almanac:
    </strong>
    An annual publication that includes information such as weather forecasts, farmers' planting dates, tide tables, and tabular information often arranged according to the calendar.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Gazetteer:
    </strong>
    A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas. They typically contain information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Directory:
    </strong>
    A listing of information for location/navigation; e.g. business direcfory, telephone directory, web directory.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Catalog:
    </strong>
    A listing of content objects (their description and location).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   More specific to the purview of IAs, information consumers depend on KOSs to browse and search content objects.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    BROWSING
   </strong>
   is "quick examination of the relevance of a number of objects which may or may not lead to a closer examination or acquisition/selection of (some of) these objects" Hjørland (2011).
   <strong>
    NAVIGATION
   </strong>
   is related, but has implications of (1) traversing a website (2) with perhaps a greater sense of direction. KOSs that support these activities include hierarchical taxonomies, faceted taxonomies, and pick lists (a drop-down UI element).
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    SEARCHING
   </strong>
   is the machine-aided pursuit of a specific piece of information. Search engines may use thesauri and synonym rings AKA synsets to convert between user search terms and indexing terms that represent content objects.
