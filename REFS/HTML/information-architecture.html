   IA is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports browsing/navigation and search of content objects (documents and metadata) stored in information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). The goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV).

  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Abrahamson &amp; Freedman's
   <em>
    A perfect mess,
   </em>
   order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is
   <em>
    optimal.
   </em>
   At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn.

   Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:

  <div class="figure">

   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings. In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structure/systems (KOS). It has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which have existed since antiquity --- as scrolls!). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge assets management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread. Beyond this general sense, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:

  </p>
  <p>
   Controlled vocabularies are very nearly synonymous with taxonomies/KOSs. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which undermine information retrieval because they are fraught with polysemes (both homographs and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms). Versus natural languages, CVs:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clearly define the SCOPE of terms;
   </li>
   <li>
    Provide some way of LINKING synonyms; and
   </li>
   <li>
    DISTINGUISH between homographs.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   CVs consist of terms and relationships. Terms are chosen if warrant exists:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    User warrant, which emerges from user search terms and feedback;
   </li>
   <li>
    Literary warrant, which emerges from review of documents and standards; and
   </li>
   <li>
    Organizational warrant, which emerges from an organization's existing standards.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   CVs are associated with content objects in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    INDEXING:
    <ul>
     <li>
      vs KEYWORDS:
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    METADATA:
   </li>
   <li>
    CATALOGING: describing
    <ul>
     <li>
      CLASSIFYING/CATEGORIZING?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Insofar as they overlap, KSOs have all the uses of CVs detailed above and may additionally serve as navigation structures.

   A controlled vocabulary (the product) or vocabulary control (the process) improves information retrieval by:
