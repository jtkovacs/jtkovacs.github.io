  <p>
   IR occurs when a user retrieves information objects AKA content objects (documents and metadata) from an information retrieval system (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases).
   <a href="#what-is-information-architecture?">
    IR requires IA.

  </p>
  <h2>
   <a name="cataloging-&amp;-indexing">

  <p>
   Information professionals work to ensure that IR (1) has good
   <strong>
    precision;
   </strong>
   (2) has
   <strong>
    good recall;
   </strong>
   and (3) is
   <a href="#interoperability">
    possible across multiple IR systems.
   </a>
   They do this by (1)
   <a href="search-engines.html">
    creating search algorithms
   </a>
   or by (2) ingesting information objects into a catalog, which includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      CATALOGING
     </strong>
     the object, i.e. describing/representing an information object with metadata, including subject headings and subheadings. Subject headings and subheadings can be combined from the beginning (precoordination) or combined by users while searching (postcoordination)
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Assigning subject headings (called "subject cataloging") entails
      <strong>
       CLASSIFYING
      </strong>
      objects. "In LIS, the term 'classification' is used to refer to three distinct but related concepts: a system of classes, ordered according to a predetermined set of principles and used to organize a set of entities; a group or class in a classification system; and the process of assigning entities to classes in a classification system" (Jacob, 2004, p.522).
     </li>
     <li>
      The first sense of classification given here (constructing classes) may also be called
      <strong>
       CATEGORIZATION,
      </strong>
      although categories are perhaps less strict than classes. "Categorization is the process of dividing the world into groups of entities whose members are in some way similar to each ... By reducing the load on memory and facilitating the efficient storage and retrieval of information, categorization serves as the fundamental cognitive mechanism that simplifies the individualâ€™s experience of the environment" (Jacob, 2004, p. 518).
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      INDEXING
     </strong>
     the object, i.e. mapping out the contents of an information object, perhaps using terms from a CV (at minimum, for named entities, an authority file should be consulted).
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Although
       <strong>
        TAGGING
       </strong>
       or keywording is occasionally used as a synonym for indexing, it is more often used to denote the opposite of indexing, in which keywords emerge from an information itself rather than from an indexing language. This allows for a grassroots view of what something is about.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      Indexing may be performed by machines when it is
      <strong>
       necessary
      </strong>
      (there are many documents; content changes quickly; speed matters) or when it is
      <strong>
       suitable
      </strong>
      (documents are inherently structured; documents fall within a small domain; documents are only text).
      <ul>
       <li>
        Automatic indexing with a CV (AKA auto-tagging, -classification, -categorization) may be rules-based (e.g., using regex) or machine learning-based (Bayesian, support vector machines, neural networks). Regardless, performance is better with pre-coordinated terms.
       </li>
       <li>
        Automatic indexing that doesn't use a CV is called information extraction, which includes
        <strong>
         entity extraction
        </strong>
        AKA entity recognition, entity identification.
        <br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Indexing may be performed by humans (professionals or social media users) when it is
      <strong>
       necessary
      </strong>
      (accuracy matters more than speed; must index nontext objects; content lacks inherent structure; content varies greatly) or
      <strong>
       feasible
      </strong>
      (few documents).
      <ul>
       <li>
        Human professional indexing consists of
        <ul>
         <li>
          analyzing content;
         </li>
         <li>
          assigning terms; and possibly
         </li>
         <li>
          assigning relevancy scores/weights to the terms.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        Human social indexing produced a
        <strong>
         folksonomy,
        </strong>
        different from the anthropological term "folk taxonomy" that describes informal categorization schemes.

   To retrieve information, users engage with information systems by:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      SEARCHING
     </strong>
     for a specific piece of information; this is the concern of back-end IA. Simultaneous search of multiple information systems is called metasearching, broadcast searching, cross-database searching, federated searching, and parallel searching.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BROWSING
     </strong>
     a collection of information; this is the concern of front-end IA, with the goal of intuitive user interfaces and navigational structures. Browsing is "quick examination of the relevance of a number of objects which may or may not lead to a closer examination or acquisition/selection of (some of) these objects" HjÃ¸rland (2011); "visually scanning through organized collections of representations of content objects" (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005, p. 157).

      <strong>
       NAVIGATION

   Rosenfeld, Morville, and Arango (2015) say that IA aims to facilitate both the finding and understanding of information. The "finding" dimension of IA is information retrieval, the legacy of library science; the "understanding" dimension comes via Richard Saul Wurman, who focused on making complex systems intelligible through visualization.

   Per Abrahamson and Freedman (2008), order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is
   <em>
    optimal.
   </em>
   At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn.

   Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies (i.e., knowledge organization structures) have different bases/origins. KOSs may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, perhaps eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:

  <p>
   Schemas and structures work together. For example, my Zotero library is a hierarchy (structure) of topical categories (schema), automatically sorted by alphabet (schema). The distinction I draw is that "schemas" are for the conceptual (abstract, disembodied) organization of information into groups, whereas "structures" describe group configuration.

  <h3>
   <a name="information-schemas">

  <p>
   Wurman (1990) claims there are only five ways to organize items. Similarly, Wyllys (2000) states that information can be organized according to different schemas that encompass Wurman's five ways (italicized):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Exact schemas
    </strong>
    (mutually exclusive, AKA classes):
    <em>
     alphabet, location, chronology, continuum
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Inexact schemas,
    </strong>
    AKA
    <em>
     categories:
    </em>
    topical, task-oriented, audience-specific, metaphor-driver (e.g., information lifecycle)
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Hybrid schemas,
    </strong>
    combining multiple methods (may be confusing)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   <a name="information-structures">
    Information structures

  </h3>
  <p>
   But, Wyllys adds, there are also three fundamental information structures, AKA
   <strong>
    data models.
   </strong>
   In their review of database history (gens 1-3), Connolly and Begg (2015) classify Wyllys' three structures as "record-based", and add "object-oriented" as another top-level category:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Record-based structures
     </strong>
     canâ€™t express constraints on the data, but express structure well
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       (1G) Hierarchical structures
      </strong>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Per Zeng (n.d.), strict hierarchies
        <strong>
         (trees)
        </strong>
        can model three different types of real-world relationships:

    What is taxonomy?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, a term synonymous with knowledge organization structures/systems (KOS) and very nearly synonymous with controlled vocabularies (CVs). As a field, taxonomy has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which existed even in antiquity as scrolls). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge asset management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond this general sense, taxonomies are also

    specific kinds of KOSs.

   <strong>
    Term lists
   </strong>
   are essentially flat list, though they may include "See"/"Use" to steer people towards preferred language, or use a synonym ring approach (no preferred term among multiple).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Authority file:
    </strong>
    Identifies the definitive version of a name among all variants
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Glossary
    </strong>
    (vocabulary, clavis, specialized dictionary): An alphabetical list of terms with definitions inside a particular domain of knowledge.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Stop list:
    </strong>
    Words to ignore in search query processing (because they are extremely common)
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Dictionary:
    </strong>
    Definitions, history, etc. for words.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Gazetteer:
    </strong>
    A geographical dictionary
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Synonym rings
   </strong>
   AKA synsets associate synonyms without indicating preference for one over the others (equivalence relationship). Synsets are usually invisible to users, e.g. underpinning a search engine.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Taxonomies
   </strong>
   AKA hierarchies AKA hierarchical taxonomies AKA tree structures arrange terms into parent/child relationships beneath a single top term (TT). A strict hierarchy requires that each term have a single parent AKA broader term (BT), though they may have multiple siblings and children AKA narrower terms (NT).
  </p>
  <p>
   Indexing a content object with a term is called posting; a given term contains X postings. The practice of indexing a content object with a broader term rather than a narrower term is called generic posting. If, instead, the content object is indexed with narrower and broader terms, this is called up-posting AKA autoposting. Generic posting also means subsuming narrower terms under a preferred broader term in a controlled vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taxonomies are a top-down approach. Thus, there may occasionally be node labels AKA blind references AKA facet indicators: terms in a CV that are never applied to a content object, but exist to preserve a coherent logical structure or to expose the logic behind choices made.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Microcontrolled vocabularies
   </strong>
   are subsets of a controlled vocabulary, creating a specialist CV.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Faceted taxonomies
   </strong>
   are a bottom-up approach to providing multiple views of the same content objects, based on shared attributes like topic, location, format, author, etc. They are often presented as navigation aids or search refinments; they may also be used to organize very large controlled vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Polyhierarchies
   </strong>
   are hierarchies in which children may have multiple parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Thesauri
   </strong>
   capture associative relationships AKA related terms (RT) in addition to equivalence (U/UF) and hierarchical (BT/NT) relationships. Relationships are also called cross-references; they should be reciprocal (explicit entry at term Y linking to term X, explicit entry at term X linking to term Y) and may or may not be symmetric. Thesauri are useful for representing a very large controlled vocabulary.
  </p>

   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   As part of ingesting a content object into an information system, KOSs can be applied to the content object at several levels, creating more or less granular pictures of what the object is about:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Subject headings applied during cataloging may be organized in hierarchical (single parent), polyhierarchical (multi-parent), and faceted taxonomies
   </li>
   <li>
    Indexing may use indexing terms from an authority file or other CV
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Information consumers depend on KOSs to browse and search content objects:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Browsing and navigating are supported by hierarchical taxonomies, faceted taxonomies, and pick lists
   </li>
   <li>
