    What is information architecture?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Information architecture (IA) is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports browsing/navigation and search of content objects (documents and metadata) stored in information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). For search (the concern of back-end IA), the goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV). For browsing (the concern of front-end IA), the goal is intuitive user interfaces and navigational structures. Another way of putting this is that IA designs for finding and for understanding.

    Must information be organized?
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Abrahamson &amp; Freedman's
   <em>
    A perfect mess,
   </em>
   order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is
   <em>
    optimal.
   </em>
   At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn.
  </p>
  <p>
   Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, perhaps eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img alt="Objective, culturally embedded, socially negotiated, and idiosyncratic taxonomies" src="../ILLOS/taxonomy_status.png"/>
   <p class="caption">

  </h1>
  <p>
   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings. In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structures/systems (KOS). The field has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which existed even antiquity as scrolls). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge asset management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond this general sense, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img src="../ILLOS/KSOs.png" width="550px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   Controlled vocabularies are very nearly synonymous with taxonomies. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which undermine information retrieval because they are fraught with polysemes (ambiguous words, both homographs/homophones and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms). Versus natural languages, CVs:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Clearly define the SCOPE of terms using scope notes (SN) and history notes (HN);
   </li>
   <li>
    Provide some way of linking SYNONYMS, which increases recall;
   </li>
   <li>
    Distinguish between HOMOGRAPHS, which increases precision; and, optionally,
   </li>
   <li>
    Capture SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS between terms, which improves both recall and precision.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   CVs consist of terms and relationships. Terms are chosen if warrant exists; this warrant may take a while to develop, leading to the category of candidate terms AKA provisional terms. Warrants have different bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    User warrant emerges from user search terms and feedback;
   </li>
   <li>
    Literary warrant emerges from review of documents and standards; and
   </li>
   <li>
    Organizational warrant emerges from an organization's existing standards.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Minimally, terms and relationship indicators must account for synonyms and homographs. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A preferred term must be designated among synonyms, and synonyms must be linked.
    <ul>
     <li>
      This is often accomplished via the indicators UF (use for) and U (use), e.g. Salinity UF Saltiness, Saltiness U Salinity.
     </li>
     <li>
      Preferred terms are also called descriptors or headings; non-preferred terms are also called entry terms or lead-in terms.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Homographs must be disambiguated with a modifier AKA difference AKA qualifier term, e.g. Mercury (metal), Mercurcy (planet).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Relationships can be much more complex; see
   <a href="#KOS-by-structure">
    KOS by structure
   </a>
   . Terms may be compound, either bound (denoting a single concept) or consisting of a focus noun plus a qualifier (in the case of homographs). Focus nouns are also called head nouns.
