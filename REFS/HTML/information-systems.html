  <pre><code>Information systems (IS) professionals work with IT professionals to create IS systems. IT people build the IT, but IS people identify the problems that an IS system may solve or the opportunities that an IS system may create, and coordinate implementation of an IS that meets the organization's needs. ISs consist of three components (the IS triangle):
    Business process: a predefined way in which an organization performs its functions
    People
    IT: hardware and software
There are three major MIS in an enterprise, collectively referred to as an organization's IS architecture:
    Enterprise systems (ES) are used to perform the daily tasks of a business, and include
        Enterprise resource planning (ERP; internal)
        Customer relationship management (CRM; external interface)
        Supply chain management (SCM; external interface)
    Business intelligence (BI) systems are used to inform strategic decisions, and include
        Reporting
        Data mining
        Decision support systems (DSS)
        Expert systems (ES)
        AI systems
    Collaboration systems (CS) are used to connect people, and include
        Groupware
        Workflow
        Collaboration
        Social Media
        Knowledge management
        Internet, extranet, intranet
System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
    Planning: defining scope, objectives/charter, budget, schedule, etc.
    Analysis: characterizing and understanding the system 'as is'; producing requirements specifications
    Design: producing IT-focused mock-ups, blueprints etc. of system 'to be'
    Development: building software/hardware
    Implementation: users encounter the built system
    [Maintaining]
    [Monitoring]
    [Improving]
    
    </code></pre>
  <p>
   Per Annabi and McGann (2014b):
  </p>
  <p>
   Evolution of IS:
  </p>
  <pre><code>Computational systems are very narrow and focused on automating tedious tasks, e.g. keeping a ledger
Functional systems are slightly broader and place automated tasks in context of all related tasks, e.g. accounting and financial reporting
Enterprise systems are broadest and try to integrate processes across functional areas, e.g. recognizing the relationship between accounting and HR, as well as bridging internal and external users</code></pre>
  <p>
   Challenges and benefits per system:
  </p>
  <pre><code>ERP: major providers are SAP, Oracle, Sage Group, Microsoft Dynamics, SSA Global Technologies
    + eliminate data inconsistencies, reporting that cover entirety of business process, better availability of data
    - costs from purchase, training, data conversion, consulting fees ... also enforce standardization of business processes, which users may resist
CRM: incl. sales, marketing, customer service, and analysis of such
    + better customer service to attract and retain customers, perform targeted marketing and experiences, discover new customers
    - hard to develop a customer-centric culture
SCM covers suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers (presumably in a way that isn't redundant to the CRM??)
    + Avoid waste in supply chain by identifying inefficiencies and improving forecasting
    - Depends on building trust among members of the supply chain; also difficult to model supply chain that can be quite complex </code></pre>
