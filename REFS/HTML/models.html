   We talk about decision-making models for normative reasons (to help us make better decisions) and positive ones (to predict or analyze others’ decisions)
  </p>
  <p>
   Multi-criterion models (many features bundled together): Can plot options in multidimensional space and calculate least distance to ideal point; this is a spatial model. A preference is spatial if people prefer things “just right” rather than infinitely large or small. Use a matrix and compare column by column; compute score or weighted score, e.g. MCRI decision
  </p>
  <p>
   Probabilistic models (uncertainty in the world): Probability basics: Classical probability: easy to calculate, e.g. for a dice Frequency: can estimate probability by counting lots of data; makes assumption of stationarity Subjective probabilities: dangerous, subject to bias, make easily violate axioms of probability Decision trees: write down payoffs and probabilities; also can infer what other people think p is based on their decisions, or calculate payoffs knowing probabilities Value of information: calculate value without and with information; then take the difference

  <p>
   Hidden actions: Effort={0,1}; Outcome={Good,Bad}; p(Good|Effort=1)=1; p(Good|Effort=0)=p; c, cost of effort=1. Contract: pay M if Good, 0 if Bad→ Payoff(effort=1)=M-c and Payoff(effort=0)=pM; set M-c&gt;pM → M&gt;c/(1-p).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hidden information: Ability={a,b}; cost(a)=c, cost(b)=C. Contract: pay M after k hours where M&gt;kc, M&lt;kC → k=M/C. Costly signaling; how does this apply to internships?
  </p>
  <p>
   Auction design: From the perspective of the seller, the objective is to get as much money as possible for a fixed amount of goods. Three basic designs: ascending bid vs. sealed bid vs. second price bid. In second price bidding, people makes a sealed bid; the highest bid wins but they actually pay the amount of the second highest bidder. For an ascending bid, the winner may not reach their upper limit; the item sells at just over the upper limit of the person with the second highest WTP. For second price bidding, a rational bidder will bid their true WTP because this maximizes ‘net gain’: WTP - actual price paid. Prevents arms race dynamic. In sealed bids, people tend to underbid; in fact, the optimal bid is WTP/2 .This turns out to be the expected value of the second highest bidder. → revenue equivalence thm
  </p>
  <p>
   Mechanisms in public goods projects: Clarke-Groves-Vickery Pivot mechanism: each person states what the project is worth to them. If the sum of these claims is higher than the cost of hte project, then the project goes ahead with each paying only the minimum amount needed to make the project viable: e.g. person_1 pays max{cost - V2 - V3 … - Vn, 0}. → everyone has an incentive to reveal their true value, rather than over- or under-bidding. All mechanisms for these sorts of problems have trade-offs.

  <p>
   Agent-based model where people choose whether to move or stay depending on the composition of their immediate neighborhood. The deep insight is that a similarity threshold of 30% has an equilibrium (everyone happy) with segregation of 70%; and 50% tolerance leads to nearly 100% segregation, including borders made up of empty cells. Perhaps counterintuitively, when intolerance is set very high, the system won’t find an equilibrium since everyone is perpetually moving. Micromotives ≠ macrobehavior I would want to augment this model, giving cell-classes their own mobility parameter. Exodus tip: agent leaves because someone else exits the neighborhood Genesis tip: agent leaves because someone else enters the neighborhood

There are a total of 256 rules: 8 neighborhood states, 2 possible responses → 28 = 256 Langton’s lamba: for a given set of rules, what % tell cells to switch on? e.g. ⅛ or ⅞

   “Three attributes of physical systems (1) simple parts (2) interacting in large numbers (3) that follow fixed rules render physical models amenable to mathematics … Systems that include people as actors– and these include ecological systems – lack the three attributes that produce regularity. The parts of these systems aren’t simple: People are sophisticated, multi-dimensional, and capable of a range of behaviors. We march to our own drummers. Further, though billions of people exist, we interact in small to moderate sized groups. Finally, we don’t follow the same fixed rules. Unlike carbon atoms, we learn. We adapt. We do crazy things.”

In this case, assuming rationality on the part of the other person is very helpful because it helps you make you own decision. When are we likely to see rationality? When the stakes are large; when decisions are repeated; when groups of people make decisions (although other phenomena like groupthink can occur); or when a problem is particularly simple. Why is rationality an important assumption? It provides a unique and comparatively easy-to-calculate benchmark; as people learn, they tend towards rationality; and many variations cancel out (i.e., high variance but no bias).

   In Prisoner’s Dilemma, the incentive to defect must be less, on average, than the payoffs available for cooperation. Here are the constraints: T&gt;R, 2T&gt;F, F&gt;T.
  </p>
  <p>
   What makes PD so interesting is that, in terms of matrix addressing, cell (1,1) is the highest overall payoff; cells (1,2) and (2,1) are Pareto efficient; but cell (2,2), the worst by every criterion, is where the game ends up. It’s the Nash equilibrium. This contrasts with the self-interest game where individual incentives lead players to achieve the highest overall payoff which is also Pareto efficient. In the case of price competition or tech adoption, we don’t care that the players suffer becomes consumers benefit. (Unless we also consider that consumers are workers.)

   7 ways that cooperation arises in 2-person games: Additional constraint b&gt;c where c=cost of cooperation, b=benefit to others. See http://books.simonandschuster.com/SuperCooperators/Martin-Nowak/9781451626636. Repeated games with opportunity for direct reciprocity. If p=p(meet again), then p&gt;c/b is the condition. Indirect reciprocity, i.e. reputation. Let q=p(reputation is known) for the condition q&gt;c/b. → denser ties better Network reciprocity with k neighbors, condition is k &gt; b/c. → denser ties worse Group selection is the mechanism where, through competing against other groups, groups with a higher percentage of cooperators are more successful.

Assumptions: Output is an increasing but concave function of labor and capital: Yt = Lt1/2 Kt1/2 Output is either consumed or invested: Yt = Ct + It and Ir = sYt Capital can accumulate, but depreciates: Kt+1 = Kt + It - dKt Result: long-run equilibrium occurs where investment = depreciation Growth eventually stops because output is concave while depreciation is linear

   “Why are some countries rich and other countries poor?” Will China keep growing? No, because huge gains early on are possible because there is so little capital relative to labor.

If this is so obvious, why are some countries stagnant?

  </p>
  <p>
   Conditions: There is an absolute minimum/maximum Movement is only possible in one direction: down/up. In math: if xt+1 ≠ xt, there is some k &gt;0 such that F(xt+1) &gt; F(xt) +/- k, that is, with each timestep the system moves by at least k amount. [Zeno’s paradox; need to define a fixed step distance otherwise we will never arrive at the maximum] Therefore, eventually, xt+1=xt. #periods_to_equilibrium ≤ (max_value - initial_value)/step_size Does the process necessarily reach a max/min? No, it can get stuck. For example, in the case of preferences, it could be that a pairwise trading scheme leads to a suboptimal allocation while a more sophisticated trading scheme would attain maximum happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hard part is constructing a Lyapunov function to represent the system. Self-organized avoidance of gridlock in cities: people have a list of places they need to go in the week, and they determine their route randomly. If they encounter a crowd at their desired location on a particular day, then they modify their route. Say the F(x) = # of people you encounter in your weekly route. This has a minimum value (0), and if people move according to their rule, then #encounters falls by at least k=2. Exchange economies &amp; externalities: each person brings items to a market, and trades only if that trade increases their happiness by k amount. F(x) = total happiness of all participants in the market. Because of externalities, though, we can’t say that this system will attain equilibrium. Participants not materially involved in a transaction may yet experience its impacts on their happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if a system has an equilibrium, we can’t necessarily determine that it does … because of externalities. E.g. Collatz problem: pick a number. If even, divide by 2. If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Stop if you ever reach 1. Does this process ever stop?

   Randomness is a quality of a variable. We want to know two things: What is the source of the randomness, i.e. the error term? What is the distribution of the randomness?

   Random walk is a process where each time step is random. A random walk has these properties: For n an even number, n flips has an expected value of 0 For any k, a random walk will cross |k| an infinite number of times; i.e., no trend will emerge For any k, a random walk will exhibit a streak/cluster of k outcomes in a row an infinite number of times Binary random walk: keep a running total when flipping a coin where H=1, T=-1 Normal random walk → Efficient Markets Hypothesis: stock prices are random walks because markets are efficient; people anticipate trends and act in ways that cancel them out. OR, p(tomorrow)=f(p(today), news_tommorow) and news is unpredictable. http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-24611-7/ But, there is too much fluctuation in stock prices, and there are consistent winners, e.g. Warren Buffett. Finite memory random walk: VT=XT + XT-1 + … XT-n

   CB is about strategic mismatch and allocation of resources, e.g. as of opposing troops forming battle fronts. One of two models, the other being Prisoner’s Dilemma, that brought game theory into policy settings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Basic CB model: 2 players with T troops trying to form N fronts, where T &gt;&gt; N. Action = allocation of troops; payoffs = # fronts won, determined by simple majority (although different fronts can have different payoffs associated with them). Reflected by a matrix of players*fronts. CB is a zero-sum game → Very competitive; “you have to work very very hard to win”. The behavior of this system is equilibrium with a random element. That is, there is an area within the space of possible choices where each player has an expected value of 0, and the winner is determined by luck. → Best strategy: randomize your troop allocation; be confusing. Any strategy can be defeated Don’t need all your troops to win If Blotto is played sequentially, the second player has enormous advantage
  </p>
  <p>
   Model where one side has an advantage in the form of more resources: As the number of fronts increases, so does the amount of additional resources needed in order to maintain an advantage. Or, the advantage of having k more troops decreases as N increases. If you’re the weaker player, what you want to do is increase the number of fronts/dimensions of competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Model where many players compete: Can have nontransitive victories → Lots of cycles, not equilibrium
  </p>
  <p>
   Applications of this model: US Electoral College, terrorism, trials, hiring

   Used in psychology, to model learning; in economics, to model populations of people learning; and in ecology, to model evolution. In a nutshell, there is a distribution containing types, and the distribution is shifting in response to the payoffs that each type experiences. The dynamics of the model offer commentary on the strategies of (1) copying the most common strategy and (2) copying the most successful strategy. Elements of model: Set of types, {1, 2, 3, … N} Payoff for/performance of each type, π(i) Proportion of each type in population, Pr(i) The proportion of any type in the next period its its population ‘weight’ divided by the sum of all types’ population weights: Prt+1(i) =Prt(i) (i)j=1NPrt(j) (j) Weights can be represented graphically by a fitness wheel where (1) the number of slices a type gets reflect its proportion, and (2) the width of the slices reflect its fitness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Can use replicator models to investigate games if proportions are specified (since payoffs are specified as part of games). This can lead to a different equilibrium that arises from rational actors. The tricky part here is calculating weights, since payoffs can vary with actions. For a 2x2 game with Pr(½,½) and where player A has payoffs a or b depending on player B’s actions, weightA=½ (½ a + ½ b).

   Fisher’s fundamental theorem: Higher variance increases rate of evolutionary adaptation. Can examine this by taking the average of each generation of low-variation and high-variation populations. Seems to run counter to Six Sigma! But SS is for a fixed problemscape, while Fisher’s is for complex systems.
