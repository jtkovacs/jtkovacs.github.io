  <h3>
   <a name="stakeholder-analysis">
    Stakeholder analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   The general aim is to identify stakeholders; analyze their interests and expectations; categorize interests and expectations based on importance and level of stakeholder influence; and develop an action plan that delimits roles for different stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Different authors present different stakeholder typologies. Per Leffingwell (2010):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Users
    </strong>
    are stakeholders
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     System stakeholders
    </strong>
    are those who:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Will use the system
     </li>
     <li>
      Will work with those who use the system
     </li>
     <li>
      Will be impacted by the deployment and operation of a system
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Project stakeholders
    </strong>
    are those who:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Have a vested interest in the project's budget and schedule
     </li>
     <li>
      Will be involved in marketing, selling, installing, or maintaining the system
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Two typologies per Rabinowitz (n.d.):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Primary
    </strong>
    stakeholders use a system directly
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Secondary
    </strong>
    stakeholders have only indirect contact
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Key
    </strong>
    stakeholders have decision-making authority
   </li>
  </ul>

   Once identified, decisions must be made about levels of stakeholder involvement. A RACI plan can capture stakeholder roles as well as roles for those involved in executing the project. Per Kantor (2012):

     <li>
      Ensure every task has at least one R, but no more than needed to accomplish the work.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ensure every task has one A, and no more.
     </li>
     <li>

    Writing a business case or proposal
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Overall, a business case must clearly outline a problem and a solution. If it's a proposal (meaning you must convince someone to hire you), you also need to demonstrate your credibility and capacity to deliver the solution.

  <ul>
   <li>
    An executive summary is not a summary; it's an articulation of the business case.
   </li>
   <li>
    Can't just echo the RFP, because readers of the full RFP and the executive summary differ.
   </li>
   <li>
    Beyond other respondents, you're competing against inertia (since the client may ultimately do nothing).

  <p>
   Per Hill &amp; Cantera (2015):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Establish a simple definition for "business process" that everyone understands. Adopt Gartner's definition as a starting point.
    <ul>
     <li>
      Management process: highest level of abstraction; processes centered on mission statement and long-term vision
     </li>
     <li>
      Administrative process: maintaining a functioning organization
     </li>
     <li>
      Operational process: day-to-day operations
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Assess proposed changes to business processes in terms of the probability of the change directly impacting the desired business outcome. A "good" change is one that improves enterprise business outcomes (not just functional unit outcomes), or that must be made for compliance reasons. Our 2014 study of business transformation initiatives shows that one-third of organizations have an insufficient understanding of their business strategy, and 35% fail to translate the business strategy into measurable business goals.
   </li>
   <li>
    Work backwards from the business outcome using 5 whys, Fishbone diagram, or customer journey mapping.
   </li>
   <li>
    A Level 0 process diagram is a simple way of communicating how the organization works. It is the highest representation of the enterprise's business operations from a process perspective ... In our view, every organization would benefit from having such a visual to facilitate communications about improving the outcomes from business operations. Such a visual should fit on a single piece of paper.
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify key processes and pair them with metrics. (Metrics can be of the form 'from X to Y' but should be outside-in; e.g.,"from purchase request to receipt".)
    <ul>
     <li>
      How do we make our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do our customers receive/experience the value of our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do we collect money for our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do we support (provide customer service for) our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do we source the raw materials or talent we need to create our product or service?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Look at the process as-is and try to simplify it, rather than leaping to IT automation as the solution. "Automation is very good for scaling work (with speed and capacity) without a commensurate increase in head count, for lowering the cost of performing the work (since, theoretically, machines can work 24/7) and for increasing the consistency of the output. If these are the kinds of improvements desired, then automation is an appropriate answer."

   <a name="defining-&amp;-managing-scope">
    Defining &amp; managing scope
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Sheen (2015), scope creep is pervasive. Scope should be clearly addressed during the project initiation phase by (1) listing what's in and out of scope, provided stakeholders agree about scope; or (2) establishing scope ranges AKA scope tolerance parameters, which can be pinpointed as information emerges. A task is out of scope if it (1) doesn't make a direct contribution to the project goal, or (2) if time and money are binding constraints.
   <strong>
    Project the impact of requested additional tasks;
   </strong>
   never simply agree to perform them.

  <p>
   In the traditional "serial" or lifecycle project management approach, requirements are translated into deliverables, deliverables are translated into a work breakdown structure (WBS), and the WBS is translated into a schedule and budget. Per Ambler (n.d.), about two-thirds of requirements elicited in this way lead to features that are never or rarely used, i.e. "spectacular levels of waste". In response, Agile tries to match development processes to the realities of constantly shifting requirements using:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    ... in place of a schedule, a
    <strong>
     stack
    </strong>

    Work breakdown structure
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Wikipedia (2017), a work breakdown structure (WBS) is a
   <strong>
    hierarchical decomposition of a project's total work.
   </strong>
   WBS elements are coded as 1.0, 1.1, 1.10.11, etc. Child elements must sum to 100% of their parent element, and so on until 100% of the project's total work is accounted for. Elements must be mutually exclusive, which is easier to accomplish if elements are
   <em>
    outcomes,
   </em>
   not tasks. There are different heuristics for establishing the terminal granularity of a WBS:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    80 hour rule: smallest element must not exceed 80 hours of work
   </li>
   <li>
    Smallest element must be small enough to occur within the standard reporting period
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once the hierarchy is established, terminal elements are budgeted and scheduled.

   </a>
   (not just user) needs; requirements determination is the process of eliciting, analyzing, and synthesizing stakeholder needs. Dennis et al. (2012) note that the analysis and design phases of a system implementation effort are very closely linked. That is, the product/s of requirements determination are "initial designs". They also note that requirements are expressed first as
   <strong>
    business requirements
   </strong>
   (from the perspective of stakeholders, including users), second as
   <strong>
    system requirements
   </strong>
   (from the perspective of developers).
  </p>
  <p>
   Requirements are also categorized as
   <strong>
    functional
   </strong>
   (what business tasks a system must perform) and
   <strong>
    nonfunctional
   </strong>
   (operational, performance, security, cultural and political requirements that affect how tasks are performed, and may arise from regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley or the desire to comply with standards such as

   </a>
   Per
   <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/82763/why-bother-differentiating-between-functional-and-nonfunctional-requirements">
    StackExchange answers,
   </a>
   is important to differentiate functional from nonfunctional requirements because:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    They apply to different levels of the system (nonfunctional = system as a whole)
   </li>
   <li>
    They are of interest to different people (or some people may only be interested in a subset of requirements)
   </li>
   <li>
    They are of interest at different points in the system development lifecycle (nonfunctional = architecture)
   </li>
   <li>
    They may be modeled/represented in different ways (nonfunctional = quality attribute scenario)
   </li>
   <li>
    Differentiating conceptually helps you be more thorough when eliciting and analyzing requirements
   </li>
   <li>
    Modularity (differentiation and cross-referencing) supports iteration
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Per Whitney (n.d.), good requirements are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Complete, correct, unambiguous, verifiable
   </li>
   <li>
    Necessary, feasible, prioritized
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Per Avison and Fitzger (2006) qtd. in Dennis et al. (2012), common problems with requirements determination are:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Inadequate access to users or access to the wrong users for requirements elicitation
   </li>
   <li>
    Requirements are inadequately specified
   </li>
   <li>
    The inevitably iterative nature of requirements is poorly managed

   <li>
    Requirements are not verified or validated

   Per Dennis et al. (2012), a requirements determination process may begin with current state analysis, yielding models of the

    as-is system
   </strong>
   (see
   <a href="modeling.html">
    notes on system, process, and interface modeling techniques
   </a>

  </p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The methodology used by the systems development team:
     </strong>
     "Users of traditional design methods such as waterfall and parallel development (see Chapter 1) typically spend significant time understanding the as-is system and identifying improvements before moving to capture requirements for the to-be system. However, newer RAD, agile, and object-oriented methodologies, such as phased development, prototyping, throwaway prototyping, extreme programming, and Scrum (see Chapter 1) focus almost exclusively on improvements and the to-be system requirements."

    <p>
     <strong>
      The context of the system being developed:

    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
     <li>
      No current system exists
     </li>
     <li>
      Little effect on current systems
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The amount of system change desired,

     i.e. BPA vs. BPI vs. BPR (see
     <a href="process-improvement.html">
      notes on process improvement

    use cases.
   </strong>
   Per Whitney (n.d.), "Use cases integrate the requirements into a comprehensive package that describes the interaction of the user with the system ... The Use Case should describe the interaction between the actor and the system - what the actor does and how the system reacts." Note that actors include other software as well as people. Use cases are expressed textually (also called a
