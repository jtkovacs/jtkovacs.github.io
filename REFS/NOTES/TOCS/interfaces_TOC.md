# 1. Prototyping

Prototyping is the practice of making a simple, quick, cheap, etc. versions of a future product, and getting user input on those versions before moving on to production. 

## 1.1. Types of interface prototypes

Per Ambler, n.d. and my friend Clint:

<table>
<tr><th>Term</th><th>Alt Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sketch</td><td>Essential UI</td><td>Conceptual model of UI</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Mock-up</td><td>Sketch</td><td>Manual rendering of a screen's appearance</td></tr>
<tr><td>Concrete prototype</td><td>Digital rendering of a screen's appearance</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Wireframe</td><td>Shows how screens interrelate</td></tr>
</table>

# 2. Types of interfaces

## 2.1. Reporting dashboards

A summary of best practies from Eckerson and Hammond (2011):

- Focus on:
    - User needs
    - Actions! not views
        - Actions that require data
        - Actions that data could suggest
    - Data quality
- Methods and workflow:
    - Get user feedback on prototypes
    - Plan to interate continuously
        - E.g., add more complexity as users become fluent
    - Create and use templates (for designer-helpful efficiency and user-friendly consistency)
- Design principles:
    - Group related elements, maybe using tabs
    - Balance visual sparsity and information density, both desirable
    - "Ideally, users should be able to view all pertinent data at a glance without clicking. Then, they should be able to view details of any top-level metric in three clicks or fewer."
    - Keep data, not decorative elements, at the forefront

## 2.2. Interactive interfaces

### 2.2.1. Forms

Per Wroblewski (n.d.), forms are used in a variety of scenarios both on- and offline:

- Shop, conduct transactions
- Log in, gain access
- Input data, give feedback

#### 2.2.1.1. Requirements and validation

- **Usability Testing:** Errors, issues, assists, completion rates, time spent 
per task, satisfaction scores
- **Field testing:** Sources used, environment, context
- **Customer Support:** Top problems, number of incidents
- **Web Conventions Survey:** Common solutions, unique approaches
- **Site Tracking:** Completion rates, entry points, exit points, elements utilized, data entered 
- **Eye Tracking:** Number of eye fixations, length of fixations, heat maps, scan paths 

#### 2.2.1.2. General best practices

- Minimize input with smart defaults, inline validation, forgiving inputs
- Provide a progress indicator
- Provide a consistent voice across pages of a form
- Indicate errors, available help, reasons for requesting data, success

#### 2.2.1.3. Best practices by form element

##### 2.2.1.3.1. Layout 

Label positions:

- Label above field: fastest completion times but may be harder to associate label with appropriate field; use if the form represents a familiar task and if _vertical space_ isn't an issue
- Label to left of field: better for associating labels with appropriate fields, but increases (as much as doubles!) form completion time
    - Right-aligned: Minimizes vertical space and distance the eye must move, but jagged left edge is harder to process
    - Left-aligned: Most time-consuming but labels are easily read
    
Content groupings 

##### 2.2.1.3.2. Input Affordances 

Per Norman (2013), an object has attributes; a person has capabilities; when a person's capabilities combine with an object's attributes, this is an affordance and we can say that the object affords action X. For example, a rock is hard; many people can move their arms and grip with their hands; therefore, a rock affords hitting something and causing damage. More coloquially, in web design an interface element that evokes and invites interaction from users.

- Based on the total number of fields and their relative incidence, choose to mark fields as required or optional 
- Field lengths should be right-sized for their content (an affordance), but fairly consistent across a form (not wildly varying lengths)


- Formats
