## ABOUT THIS SITE

This site is a [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) on __information management__ (technology management, people management, enterprise information systems, knowledge management, business intelligence, design, process improvement, data science, statistics, machine learning, databases, personal productivity, business research, information security ... etc.).

It is an ongoing project, i.e., a [mess](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132176.A\_Perfect\_Mess). I have high hopes though, that it will

* let me build an overview of how the topics I study interrelate (important for [global learners](http://www.umich.edu/~elements/fogler&gurmen/html/course/lectures/two/learners.htm));
* be a to-do list for studying;
* be a single portal to references created by myself and others;
* let me summarize and synthesize ideas by posing and answering key questions (worse than but similar to [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/));
* be helpful to others as a reference (worse than but similar to [Research Methods Knowledge Base](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/index.php)).

## NAVIGATION 

Until I figure out GitBook [[1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9843609/view-markdown-files-offline), [2](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip), [3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-html)], here's a [clickable table of contents](SUMMARY.md). Contents are structured similar to [Detlor (2010)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401209001510), to encompass the __lifecycle of information__:

- ___MANAGE___ human and process dimensions;
- ___CREATE___ new data through research or ___ACQUIRE___ it elsewhere;
- ___ORGANIZE___ data and ___STORE___ it in usable, scalable, secure systems;
- ___USE___ data science (programming) or BI software to ___ANALYZE___ data and extract its value;
- ___DISTRIBUTE___ information through various media and platforms.
