# What is information architecture?

IA is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports browsing/navigation and search of content objects (documents and metadata) stored in information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). The goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV).

## Must information be organized?

Per Abrahamson & Freedman's _A perfect mess,_ order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is _optimal._ At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn. 

Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, perhaps eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:

![Objective, culturally embedded, socially negotiated, and idiosyncratic taxonomies](../ILLOS/taxonomy_status.png)

# What is taxonomy and vocabulary control?

Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings. In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structures/systems (KOS). The field has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which existed even antiquity as scrolls). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge asset management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread. 

Beyond this general sense, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:

Controlled vocabularies are very nearly synonymous with taxonomies. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which undermine information retrieval because they are fraught with polysemes (ambiguous words, both homographs/homophones and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms). Versus natural languages, CVs:

- Clearly define the SCOPE of terms using scope notes (SN) and history notes (HN);
- Provide some way of linking SYNONYMS, which increases recall; 
- Distinguish between HOMOGRAPHS, which increases precision; and, optionally,
- Capture SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS between terms, which improves both recall and precision.

## What activities comprise vocabulary control?

- Construction
- Testing
- Maintenance

... within a CV management system.

## Basic elements of CVs

CVs consist of terms and relationships

Terms may be compound ... 

Terms are chosen if warrant exists:

- User warrant, which emerges from user search terms and feedback;
- Literary warrant, which emerges from review of documents and standards; and
- Organizational warrant, which emerges from an organization's existing standards.

 --- minimally, between synonyms and homographs. 
 
## What types of KOS exist?

- Term lists (authority files, glossaries, dictionaries, and gazetteers, controlled vocabularies [which may have "See" or "Use" to steer people towards preferred language, or use a "synonym ring/synset" approach of no preferred term among multiple])
- Classifications and categories (subject headings, classification schemes, hierarchical AKA nested taxonomies, categorization schemes)
- Relationship lists (thesauri [good for representing a very large controlled vocabulary], semantic networks, ontologies)
    - Tom Gruber: "An ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse ... ontology can be viewed as a level of abstraction of data models, analogous to hierarchical and relational models." In other words, there are Three Big Data Models: hierarchical, relational, and ontological/atomic

Taxonomies by function:

- Support indexing with a controlled vocabulary, thesaurus, and/or authority file
- Support retrieval with faceted taxonomies and thesauri
- Support navigation with hierarchical taxonomies

By structure:

- List
- Synring/synset
- Taxonomy/hierarchy
- Thesaurus
- [Ontology/graph]

By major application:
Major applications of CVs:
Major applications of non-CV KSOs:

- Pick list
- Cataloging & subject headings
- Indexing: saying what something is about in maximalist fashion, identifying what’s discussed and where it’s discussed
- Tagging: saying what something is about in summary fashion, with keywords; also allows for grassroots view of what something’s about
- Categorizing: allocate something into one of existing categories, vs creating categories???
- Classifying: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/774e/ab27b22aa92dfaa9aeeeafbe845058e85f58.pdf 

In order of complexity:

- Reference works: Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs.
    - Dictionary: 
        - A collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically, which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, translation, etc.
        - A book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon.
    - Lexicon: The ‘catalog’ of a language’s words, which together with a ‘grammar’ constitutes the language.
    - Thesaurus:
    - Encyclopedia: A type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.
    - Bibliography:
    - Catalog:
    - Gazetteer: A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas. They typically contain information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent.
    - Directory: A listing of information for location/navigation; e.g. business direcfory, telephone directory, web directory
- Term lists:
    - Authority file: What’s the definitive version of a term, at least one variant of which I know?
    - Glossary (vocabulary, clavis, specialized dictionary): An alphabetical list of terms with definitions inside a particular domain of knowledge.
    - Dictionary
    - Gazetteer
- Classifications:

    - Hierarchical taxonomies
    - Polyhierarchical taxonomy

- Relationship lists:

Per meta data model:

- Relational model
- Hierarchical model
- Ontological/graph/network/triples model

## Uses of KOS & CVs 
 
CVs are associated with content objects in the following ways:

- INDEXING: 
    - vs KEYWORDS: words that emerge as important from a content object
- METADATA: 
- CATALOGING: describing 
    - CLASSIFYING/CATEGORIZING?

Insofar as they overlap, KSOs have all the uses of CVs detailed above and may additionally serve as navigation structures.
