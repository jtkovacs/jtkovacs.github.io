# Must information be organized?

Per Abrahamson & Freedman's _A perfect mess,_ order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is _optimal._ At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, _shared_ information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn. 

Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) **objective,** with obvious empirical basis; (2) **socially-negotiated,** eventually becoming (3) **culturally embedded;** or (4) **idiosyncratic:**
