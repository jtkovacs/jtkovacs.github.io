# What are information systems (IS)?

Per Annabi and McGann (2014a):

Information systems (IS) professionals work with IT professionals to create IS systems. IT people build the IT, but IS people identify the problems that an IS system may solve or the opportunities that an IS system may create, and coordinate implementation of an IS that meets the organization's needs. ISs consist of three components (the IS triangle):

- Business process: a predefined way in which an organization performs its functions
- People
- IT: hardware and software
    
## Evolution of IS
    
Per Annabi and McGann (2014b):

- Computational systems are very narrow and focused on automating tedious tasks, e.g. keeping a ledger
- Functional systems are slightly broader and place automated tasks in context of all related tasks, e.g. accounting and financial reporting
- Enterprise systems are broadest and try to integrate processes across functional areas, e.g. recognizing the relationship between accounting and HR, as well as bridging internal and external users

## What are MIS?
    
There are three major MIS in an enterprise, collectively referred to as an organization's **IS architecture.** Each systems offers benefits and poses challenges. 


### Enterprise systems (ES)

ES are used to perform the daily tasks of a business, and include:

- **Enterprise resource planning (ERP):** internal
    - \- Major providers are SAP, Oracle, Sage Group, Microsoft Dynamics, SSA Global Technologies
    - \+ eliminate data inconsistencies, reporting that cover entirety of business process, better availability of data
    - \- costs from purchase, training, data conversion, consulting fees ... also enforce standardization of business processes, which users may resist
- **Customer relationship management (CRM):** external interface; incl. sales, marketing, customer service, and analysis of such
    - \+ better customer service to attract and retain customers, perform targeted marketing and experiences, discover new customers
    - \- hard to develop a customer-centric culture
- **Supply chain management (SCM):** external interface; covers suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers (presumably in a way that isn't redundant to the CRM??)
    - \+ Avoid waste in supply chain by identifying inefficiencies and improving forecasting
    - \- Depends on building trust among members of the supply chain; also difficult to model supply chain that can be quite complex 

## Business intelligence (BI)

BI systems are used to inform strategic decisions, and include:

- Reporting
- Data mining
- Decision support systems (DSS)
- Expert systems (ES)
- AI systems

### Collaboration systems (CS)

CS are used to connect people, and include:

- Groupware
- Workflow
- Collaboration
- Social media
- Email
- Knowledge management
- Internet, extranet, intranet

        
        
        
# Implementing IS 

## Common pitfalls & best practices

Per Bloch, Blumberg, and Laartz (n.d.), IT projects often suffer major delays and budget overruns. Best practices to avoid or limit these unwelcome outcomes:

- Focus on strategy and stakeholders, not exclusively budget and scheduling
- Ensure talent is sufficient to execute the project
- Align team incentives with project incentives and have adequate team infrastructure
- Have excellent project management, including short delivery cycles and quality checks

## System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
  
- Planning: defining scope, objectives/charter, budget, schedule, etc.
- Analysis: characterizing and understanding the system 'as is'; producing requirements specifications
- Design: producing IT-focused mock-ups, blueprints etc. of system 'to be'
- Development: building software/hardware
- Implementation: users encounter the built system
- [Maintaining]
- [Monitoring]
- [Improving]
