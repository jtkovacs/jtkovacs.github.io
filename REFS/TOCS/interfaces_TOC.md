# Types of interfaces

## Reporting

## Interaction

### Forms

Per Wroblewski (n.d.), forms are used in a variety of scenarios both on- and offline:

- Shop, conduct transactions
- Log in, gain access
- Input data, give feedback

#### Requirements and validation

- **Usability Testing:** Errors, issues, assists, completion rates, time spent 
per task, satisfaction scores
- **Field testing:** Sources used, environment, context
- **Customer Support:** Top problems, number of incidents
- **Web Conventions Survey:** Common solutions, unique approaches
- **Site Tracking:** Completion rates, entry points, exit points, elements utilized, data entered 
- **Eye Tracking:** Number of eye fixations, length of fixations, heat maps, scan paths 

#### General best practices

- Minimize input with smart defaults, inline validation, forgiving inputs
- Provide a progress indicator
- Provide a consistent voice across pages of a form
- Indicate errors, available help, reasons for requesting data, success

#### Best practices by form element

##### Layout 

Label positions:

- Label above field: fastest completion times but may be harder to associate label with appropriate field; use if the form represents a familiar task and if _vertical space_ isn't an issue
- Label to left of field: better for associating labels with appropriate fields, but increases (as much as doubles!) form completion time
    - Right-aligned: Minimizes vertical space and distance the eye must move, but jagged left edge is harder to process
    - Left-aligned: Most time-consuming but labels are easily read
    
Content groupings 

##### Input Affordances 

Per Norman (2013), an object has attributes; a person has capabilities; when a person's capabilities combine with an object's attributes, this is an affordance and we can say that the object affords action X. For example, a rock is hard; many people can move their arms and grip with their hands; therefore, a rock affords hitting something and causing damage. More coloquially, in web design an interface element that evokes and invites interaction from users.

- Based on the total number of fields and their relative incidence, choose to mark fields as required or optional 
- Field lengths should be right-sized for their content (an affordance), but fairly consistent across a form (not wildly varying lengths)
