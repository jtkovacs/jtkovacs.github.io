# What is project management?

## Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

## Agile


# Launching a project

## Evaluating feasibility & desirability

### PESTEL analysis

### Five forces analysis

### SWOT analysis

### Gap analysis

Current state, future state

### Stakeholder analysis

identify stakeholders and analyze their interests and expectations; categorize interests and expectations based on importance; and develop an action plan.

### Force field analysis

## Writing a business case or proposal

Overall, a business case must clearly outline a problem and a solution. If it's a proposal (meaning you must convince someone to hire you), you also need to demonstrate your credibility and capacity to deliver the solution.

Per Tom Sant as summarized by Obuchowski (2015), the seven deadly sins of proposal writing and their remedies:

1. Failure to focus on the client’s business problems and payoffs; the content sounds generic. --> **Research the client**
2. No clear differentiation of this customer compared with other customers. --> **Research the client**
3. Failure to offer a compelling value proposition and clear solution. --> **Research the client**
4. No persuasive structure --- the proposal is an "information dump". --> **Select, edit, curate!**
5. Key points are difficult to read because they’re full of jargon, too long, or too technical. --> **Simplify language**
6. Key points are buried --- no punch, no highlighting. --> **Use structuring devices thoughtfully**
7. Credibility killers --- misspellings, grammar and punctuation errors, use of the wrong client’s name, inconsistent formatting, and similar mistakes. --> **Proofread**
