# What's the scientific method?

... the quest to produce useful, high-quality knowledge.

## Institutions of scientific knowledge production

What are major institutions of knowledge production, and how well are they working?

### Academic apprenticeship

#### How does disciplinary training impact knowledge?

### Peer review & replicability

### Libraries & the accumulation of knowledge

## Academic vs. practitioner knowledge

## Expert vs. crowdsourced knowledge



# The research process

## Generating questions

## Operationalizing concepts

## Reviewing literature

### Strategies for finding articles

### Strategies for reading well

Adler, M. J. (). _How to read a book._

### What is a literature review?

The important thing to understand is that a literature review proper is a research method; it is not peripheral to research.

### What types of literature reviews exist?

## Sampling

## Choosing a research method

What are major study designs and purposes? E.g. experiment, difference-in-differences, etc. What exists; how things are connected; what might happen.

Qualitative methods are premised on the ontological position that the world is multifaceted; the epistemological position that one explores a multifaceted world through people's subjectivities; and the political position that including a wider range of subjectivities in knowledge production leads to more just, effective decision-making. See GEOG 425 - Final paper.

- Interviews
    - Critical incident technique
- Participant-observation
- Focus group

## Analyzing data

## Communicating results
