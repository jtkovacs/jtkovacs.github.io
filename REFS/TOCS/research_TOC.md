# What's the scientific method?

... the quest to produce useful, high-quality knowledge.

## Institutions of scientific knowledge production

What are major institutions of knowledge production, and how well are they working?

### Academic apprenticeship

#### How does disciplinary training impact knowledge?

### Peer review & replicability

### Libraries & the accumulation of knowledge

## Academic vs. practitioner knowledge

## Expert vs. crowdsourced knowledge



# The research process

## Generating questions

## Operationalizing concepts

## Sampling

## Choosing a research method

## Analyzing data

See [notes on qualitative methods,](qualitative-methods.html), [data analysis](data-analysis.html) and [models](models.html).
