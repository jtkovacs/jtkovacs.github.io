# What is security? 


## What are major categories of security threats & defenses?


## What are security-relevant certifications?

- Microsoft has (obviously) product-specific certifications; the IT infrastructure track of their MTA certification covers security and networking, but might be too basic. 
- CompTIA has security-relevant product-neutral certifications: A+, Network+, Security+, Cybersecurity, Advanced Security Practitioner. These look like the best place to start, to understand the underlying hardware and concepts. 
- EC-Council has Network Defender, Ethical Hacker, Security Analyst, and Forensic Investigator.
- CyberSecurity Institute has a Forensic Analyst cert.
- ISACA is mostly focused on information systems security but also offers Cybersecurity.
- (ISC)<sup>2</sup> has various certs for info systems and cyber security.
