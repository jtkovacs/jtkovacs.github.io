   The first computerized information systems imitated hierarchical paper filing systems. File and data formats were specific to an application or language; applications were specific to a department. This arrangement led to
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     redundancy:
    </strong>
    the same data collected and stored by multiple departments;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     inconsistency:
    </strong>
    redundant data that
    <em>
     should be
    </em>
    the same not updated consistently;
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     inaccessibility:
    </strong>
    software developers were needed to write queries and integrate data across applications; no ad hoc queries or data processing.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>
   <a name="database-approach">
    Database approach
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   A database addresses the aforementioned problems because it is
   <strong>
    centralized
   </strong>
   (reducing redundancy, improving consistency, enabling data integration) and
   <strong>
    abstracted
   </strong>
   (available as a black box to interface with many different applications; offering a language for ad hoc queries). In a database,
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Data is formatted according to a data model;
   </li>
   <li>
    Data is managed via a database management system
    <strong>
     (DBMS),
    </strong>
    which includes
    <strong>
     data sublanguages:
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      a data definition language
      <strong>
       (DDL)
      </strong>
      that expresses a schema, stored in the
      <strong>
       system catalog
      </strong>
      (AKA data directory, data dictionary);
     </li>
     <li>
      a data manipulation language
      <strong>
       (DML),
      </strong>
      <ul>
       <li>
        which includes the capacity to query (retrieve) the data and is therefore often called a query language (though technically incorrect);
       </li>
       <li>
        which also includes the capacity to create, update, and delete data;
       </li>
       <li>
        which may be procedural or, as with SQL, nonprocedural/declarative;
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      access to metadata about the database, i.e., the system catalog;
     </li>
     <li>
      support for concurrent access
      <strong>
       (data sharing);
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      enforcement of access authorization
      <strong>
       (security);
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      enforcement of constraints on data input
      <strong>
       (integrity);
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      backup and recovery;
     </li>
     <li>
      views that are customized to the needs of specific audiences;
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Other applications can interact with the data by communicating with the DBMS.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Some definitions:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Database
    </strong>
    = Data + DBMS
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Database System
    </strong>
    = Database + Database Applications
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Database Environment
    </strong>
    = Hardware + Software + Data + Procedures + People
   </li>
  </ul>

   This is one way of thinking about database abstraction/separation, which, in general, makes the database easier to change and maintain by providing
   <strong>
    logical data independence
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    physical data independence:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     External level:
    </strong>
    Views for different users (subsets and derivations of data). Described by subschemas; logically independent from conceptual level.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Conceptual level:
    </strong>
    Logical structure of the entire database: all entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. Described by conceptual schema; physically independent from internal level.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Internal level:
    </strong>
    Implementation details, including storage allocation, data compression, and encryption. Described by internal schema.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Then,
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the DBMS creates
    <strong>
     mappings
    </strong>
    between schemas (also called intensions);
   </li>
   <li>
    a realization of a schema is called the extension or state of the database.
   </li>
  </ul>
