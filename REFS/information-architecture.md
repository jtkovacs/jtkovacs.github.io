# Must information be organized?

Per Abrahamson & Freedman's _A perfect mess,_ order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is _optimal._ At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, _shared_ information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn. 

Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) **objective,** with obvious empirical basis; (2) **socially-negotiated,** eventually becoming (3) **culturally embedded;** or (4) **idiosyncratic:**

# What is information architecture?

IA is one of several disciplines (e.g. library science, information science, taxonomy) that supports browsing/navigation and search of content objects (documents and metadata) stored in information systems (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases). The goal is information retrieval with good precision and good recall, which requires that content objects be described consistently, i.e. with a controlled vocabulary (CV).

## What is taxonomy/KOS/controlled vocabulary?

Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings. In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, synonymous with knowledge organization structure/systems (KOS); however, a taxonomy is also a specific kind of KOS with a hierarchical structure:

In addition, taxonomies/KOSs are very nearly synonymous with controlled vocabularies. CVs stand in contrast with natural languages, which are fraught with polysemes (both homographs and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms) that undermine information retrieval. A controlled vocabulary (the product) or vocabulary control (the process) improves information retrieval by:

p. 19 of ANSI/NISO Z39.19 

## What types of taxonomies/KOS exist?

- Term lists (authority files, glossaries, dictionaries, and gazetteers, controlled vocabularies [which may have "See" or "Use" to steer people towards preferred language, or use a "synonym ring/synset" approach of no preferred term among multiple])
- Classifications and categories (subject headings, classification schemes, hierarchical AKA nested taxonomies, categorization schemes)
- Relationship lists (thesauri [good for representing a very large controlled vocabulary], semantic networks, ontologies)
    - Tom Gruber: "An ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse ... ontology can be viewed as a level of abstraction of data models, analogous to hierarchical and relational models." In other words, there are Three Big Data Models: hierarchical, relational, and ontological/atomic

Taxonomies by function:

- Support indexing with a controlled vocabulary, thesaurus, and/or authority file
- Support retrieval with faceted taxonomies and thesauri
- Support navigation with hierarchical taxonomies

History: ... in libraries, from antiquity; in companies, very marginally from the 1980s and increasingly after the emergence of the web in the 1990s.

By major application:
Major applications of CVs:
Major applications of non-CV KSOs:

- Cataloging & subject headings
- Indexing: saying what something is about in maximalist fashion, identifying what’s discussed and where it’s discussed
- Tagging: saying what something is about in summary fashion, with keywords; also allows for grassroots view of what something’s about
- Categorizing: allocate something into one of existing categories, vs creating categories???
- Classifying: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/774e/ab27b22aa92dfaa9aeeeafbe845058e85f58.pdf 

In order of complexity:

- Reference works: Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs.
    - Dictionary: 
        - A collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically, which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, translation, etc.
        - A book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon.
    - Lexicon: The ‘catalog’ of a language’s words, which together with a ‘grammar’ constitutes the language.
    - Thesaurus:
    - Encyclopedia: A type of reference work or compendium holding a comprehensive summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.
    - Bibliography:
    - Catalog:
    - Gazetteer: A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas. They typically contain information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent.
    - Directory: A listing of information for location/navigation; e.g. business direcfory, telephone directory, web directory
- Term lists:
    - Authority file: What’s the definitive version of a term, at least one variant of which I know?
    - Glossary (vocabulary, clavis, specialized dictionary): An alphabetical list of terms with definitions inside a particular domain of knowledge.
    - Dictionary
    - Gazetteer
- Classifications:
    - Subject headings
    - Classification schemes
    - Hierarchical taxonomies
    - Polyhierarchical taxonomy
    - Faceted taxonomies
- Relationship lists:
    - Thesaurus
    - Ontology
    - Semantic network
- Controlled vocabulary:
    - Synonym rings/synset

Per meta data model:

- Relational model
- Hierarchical model
- Ontological/graph/network/triples model
