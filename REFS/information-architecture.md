# Must information be organized?

Per Abrahamson & Freedman's _A perfect mess,_ order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is _optimal._ At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, _shared_ information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn. 

Somewhat related, Heather Hedden (2016) offers this typology in which taxonomies may be (1) **objective,** with obvious empirical basis; (2) **socially-negotiated,** eventually becoming (3) **culturally embedded;** or (4) **idiosyncratic:**

# What is information architecture?

## What is taxonomy?

Per Hedden, taxonomy has both general and specific senses. In general, a taxonomy is a knowledge organization structure, very nearly synonymous with a controlled vocabulary (only the use of CVs in technical writing prevents total equivalence):

A CV stands in contrast with natural language. Since natural language is fraught with polysemes (both homographs and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms), it undermines information retrieval (typically measured in terms of precision and recall). A controlled vocabulary (the product) or vocabulary control (the process) improves information retrieval by:
