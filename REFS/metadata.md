# What is metadata?

# What is a metadata element set or standard?

# What is it for?

# Interoperability

Per Duval et al. (2002, my emphases), the goal is enabling "application designers to mix a variety of **semantic modules** within a common **syntactic foundation".** The semantic and machine ioteroperability of metadata is facilitated by adherance to the following principles:

- **Modularity:** thematic modules populating clearly delineated namespaces in objects across the web (in other words, the difficulty is not in combining different metadata element sets; the difficulty is indicating when and where different MES are being used)
- **Extensibility:** it should be possible to customize a MES by adding elements beyond those in the base schema, which could then be selectively ignored by any interoperability mechanisms
- **Refinability:** 
    - elements should have predefined qualifiers so that users can choose their level of detail
    - elements should include recommended controlled vocabularies or encoding schemes, that users may follow or not
- **Multilingualism:** strive to make information globally accessible through
    - internationalization: the development of 'neutral' standards
    - localization: the adaptation of international standards to local needs
