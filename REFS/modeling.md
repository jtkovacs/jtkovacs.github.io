# Modeling systems & processes

_The following notes are largely based on Steirn (1999)._

The representation of a system needs contextual metadata clarifying the date and/or version it describes. 

## Flow charts

AKA decision flow charts, logic flow charts, and logical decision flow charts. This modeling methodology is contemporaneous with structured programming. Flow charts model decisions, which is one type of process; so languages for modeling processes more generally can also represent decisions.

The basic elements of flow charts are available in MS Visio's language level diagrams stencil:

- **Parallellograms** for inputs
- **Diamonds** for decisions
- **Rectangles** for functions
- **Hardcopy symbol** (rectangle with wavy bottom edge) for outputs

### Nassi-Schneiderman (N-S) diagram

AKA Chapin charts, structograms, structured flowcharts.

N-S diagrams are an alternative to pseudocode.
An N-S diagram can be drawn using text and lines (or completely with ASCII characters).
N-S diagrams show processing by series, by selection, or by iteration.
N-S diagrams are read from top to bottom.
N-S diagrams are more structured than flowcharting (one start, one end).
