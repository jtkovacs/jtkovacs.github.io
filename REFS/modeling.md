# Modeling systems & processes

_The following notes are largely based on Steirn (1999)._

The representation of a system needs contextual metadata clarifying the date and/or version it describes. 

## Flow charts

AKA decision flow charts, logic flow charts, and logical decision flow charts. Flow charts model **decisions,** a type of process. Languages that model processes more generally can also represent decisions.

The basic elements of flow charts are available in MS Visio's language level diagrams stencil:

- **Parallellograms** for inputs
- **Diamonds** for decisions
- **Rectangles** for functions
- **Hardcopy symbol** (rectangle with wavy bottom edge) for outputs

### Nassi-Schneiderman (N-S) diagram

AKA Chapin charts, structograms, structured flowcharts. Per Nassi and Shneiderman (1973), "We propose a flowchart language whose control structure is closer to that of language amenable to **structured programming:"**

## Entity-relationship diagrams

### Bachmann/crow-foot notation

This is a notation that describes the cardinality and optionality/modality/participation of a relationship, so it can be used within other modeling systems. Crows-foot notation annotates relationships with the symbols

- **Open circle** for optional participation (zero to many)
- **Bar** for mandatory participation (one to many)
- **Bar** for one
- **Crow-foot** for many
