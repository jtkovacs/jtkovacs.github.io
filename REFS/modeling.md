# Modeling systems & processes

_The following notes are largely based on Steirn (1999) and Smartdraw.com (n.d.)._

The representation of a system needs contextual metadata clarifying the date and/or version it describes. 



## Flow charts

AKA decision flow charts, logic flow charts, and logical decision flow charts. Flow charts model **decisions,** a type of process. Languages that model processes more generally can also represent decisions.

The basic elements of flow charts are available in MS Visio's language level diagrams stencil:

- **Parallellograms** for inputs
- **Diamonds** for decisions
- **Rectangles** for functions
- **Hardcopy symbol** (rectangle with wavy bottom edge) for outputs

### Nassi-Schneiderman (N-S) diagram

AKA Chapin charts, structograms, structured flowcharts. Per Nassi and Shneiderman (1973), "We propose a flowchart language whose control structure is closer to that of language amenable to **structured programming:"**

## Entity-relationship diagrams

All ERDs capture the entities in a system, along with their attributes and interrelationships. Per Dybka (2014), there are many notation styles:

- **Crow's foot**
- **Martin**
- [Chen](../ILLOS/chens.png)
- [Baker](../ILLOS/bakers.png)
- [Arrow](../ILLOS/arrow.png)
- [IDEF1X](../ILLOS/idef1x.png)
- [UML](../ILLOS/UML-relationships.png)

### Bachmann/crow's foot notation

This is a notation that describes the optionality/modality/participation and cardinality/multiplicity of a relationship, so it can be used within other modeling systems. Crows-foot notation annotates relationships with the symbols:

- **Open circle** for optional participation (zero to many)
- **Bar** for mandatory participation (one to many)
- **Crow-foot** for many
- **Bar** for one

## Data flow diagrams

The Gane-Sarson and Yourdon-Coad notations are slightly different, but both depict the flow of data through a system using the following elements:

- **Circles** to represent system processes that transform the data
- **Lines** to represent data flows, with descriptive labels and arrows for directionality
- **Open rectangles** to represent internal data stores
- **Rectangles** to represent external interactors

## Object-oriented modeling

OO models show **inheritance** as well as decisions, relationships, and processes. Per Steirn (1999), several earlier methods (Shlaer/Mellor, Rumbaugh's Object Modeling Technique (OMT), Booch) were subsumed by UML in 1997.
