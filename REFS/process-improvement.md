## Business process automation (BPA)

BPA is focused on making current processes more efficient through automation; it requires thorough analysis of the current system.

### Problem analysis

This entails asking current system users about problems they face or features they desire. Problems identified with this technique are often related to UI and their resolution produces little if any business value.

### Root cause analysis

This entails asking current system users to explore the root causes of problems they've identified (since these problems may only be symptoms). Root causes may be uncovered by asking "Why?" five times; causal relationships may be represented as a hierarchy, web, or fishbone/Ishikawa diagram.

## Business process improvement (BPI)

BPI goes beyond increased efficiency to the realm of increased effectiveness, for instance taking advantage of new opportunities and technologies.
    
### Duration analysis

First, major processes are timed; second, all individual steps in those processes are timed. If the sum of step durations is smaller than the overall duration, this indicates a need for improvement --- which may be achieved through **integration** (fewer people involved in doing the work across its lifecycle) or **parallelization** (steps being done concurrently).

### Activity-based costing

Steps in a process are costed, and improvement efforts are focused on the costliest step.

### Informal bench-marking 

Examine competitors to identify performance targets and process improvements.
    
## Business process reengineering (BPR)

BPR is a radical upending of current business processes and systems, so spends little time analyzing them.

### Outcome analysis

Trying to think about the business from the perspective of users' ultimate goals and needs (recognizing that your product or service may be only a means to an end).

### Technology analysis

Reviewing existing and emerging technologies and asking how they might be applied in your company (either as a process improvement or a product).

### Activity elimination

Systematically (but as a thought exercise) eliminating each step in a process, and asking what the implications are.
