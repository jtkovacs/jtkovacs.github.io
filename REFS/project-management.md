## Evaluating feasibility & desirability

PESTEL, Porter's five, and SWOT/SLOT analyses are more common in the context of organizational strategic planning, but can also be scoped for projects.

### PESTEL analysis

Systematic review of the broadest trends and forces that constitute the business environment, to identify the implications for organizational strategy (since projects should be related to an organization's strategic goals):

- **Political:** trade policy, international relations, fiscal policy, electoral cycle, tax policy
- **Economic:** unemployment, disposable income, exchange rates, interest rates, trade tariffs, inflation, taxation 
- **Social:** demographics, ethics, consumer attitudes, media
- **Technological:** maturity of various technologies, trends
- **Environmental:** ecological impacts of operations, consumer attitudes
- **Legal:** patents & licensing, employment law, consumer protections, industry-specific regulations, environmental protections, competitive regulations

### Porter's five forces analysis

Framework for evaluating the intensity of competition in a specific market or industry, which may have implications for whether a project is worth undertaking or may point to profitable niches:

- Bargaining power of **consumers**
- Bargaining power of **suppliers**
- Threat of **established competitors**
- Threat of **new entrants**
- Threat of **product substitutes**

### SWOT/SLOT analysis

Framework for making connections between a company's external landscape and internal characteristics (which can be restricted to the scope of a single project). Data is collected and sorted into a matrix, with one matrix for each alternative under consideration:

- Internal **strengths**
- Internal **weaknesses** or liabilities
- External **opportunities**
- External **threats**

### Gap analysis

Also called need-gap analysis, need analysis, or need assessment. Gap analysis is a way of ensuring that planned actions align with objectives and present a reasonable pathway from the current reality to the desired state. The 5 whys or fishbone/Ishikawa/cause-and-effect diagrams may be useful in analyzing the current reality to identify possible actions.

| Objective | Reality | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 widgets daily | 2 widgets | Hire more workers |

### Force field analysis

lists the forces that help or hinder an organization's ability to make change

### Stakeholder analysis

identify stakeholders and analyze their interests and expectations; categorize interests and expectations based on importance; and develop an action plan.

## Writing a business case or proposal

Overall, a business case must clearly outline a problem and a solution. If it's a proposal (meaning you must convince someone to hire you), you also need to demonstrate your credibility and capacity to deliver the solution.

Per Tom Sant as summarized by Obuchowski (2015), the seven deadly sins of proposal writing and their remedies:

<table>
<tr><td style="text-align:left; width:420px;">Failure to focus on the client’s business problems and payoffs; the content sounds generic.</td>
<td style="width:160px;" rowspan=3>**Research the client**</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">No clear differentiation of this customer compared with other customers.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">Failure to offer a compelling value proposition and clear solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">No persuasive structure --- the proposal is an "information dump".</td>
<td rowspan=3>**Use structuring devices and simple language**</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">Key points are difficult to read because they’re full of jargon, too long, or too technical.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">Key points are buried --- no punch, no highlighting.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left;">Credibility killers --- misspellings, grammar and punctuation errors, use of the wrong client’s name, inconsistent formatting, and similar mistakes.</td>
<td>**Proofread**</td></tr>
</table>
