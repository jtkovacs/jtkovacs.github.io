# Hardware and OS

I need full admin privileges, access to specific software, and a computer for tinkering without jeopardizing data and cash.

# Browsing

I can access things privately and securely, but my browser doesnâ€™t get too slow; I can better manage my time and attention online.

## Which browser?

- Firefox: built-in reading mode; less resource use, slower but lazy tab loading; customizable; open source, values privacy, maybe less secure
- Chrome: faster, less private but more secure
- Orbot & Orfox: mobile, through Tor

# Planning & learning

# Sync & backup

# Publishing & communication

I can communicate on-the-go and securely with friends and professionals. I have excellent, up-to-date portfolios.
