    1. What is data mining?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Per Sharda et al. (2014), the field of data mining draws on
   <em>
    statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning
   </em>
   to create data mining tools that facilitate the discovery of meaningful patterns in large BI datasets(see
   <a href="https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/bi.html">
    notes on BI systems).
   </a>
   Adapted from Sharda et al. (2014, p. 157), there are three general patterns sought:

  <p>
   "Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool for solving classification problems. The objective is to sort cases (e.g., people, things, events) into groups, or clusters, so that the degree of association is strong among members of the same cluster and weak among members of different clusters" (Sharda et al., 2014, pp. 180).

    2.1.1. Clustering versus classification
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Sharda et al. (2014, p. 172), "Even though clustering ... can also be used to determine groups (or class memberships) of things, there is a significant difference between the two. Classification learns the function between the characteristics of things (i.e., [their] independent variables) and their membership (i.e., output variable) through a supervised learning process where both types (input and output) of variables are presented to the algorithm; in clustering, the membership of the objects is learned through an unsupervised learning process where only the input variables are presented to the algorithm. Unlike classification, clustering does not habe a supervising (or controlling) mechanism that enforces the learning process; instead, clustering algorithms use one or more heuristics (e.g., multidimensional distance measure) to discover natural groupings of objects."

  <h3 id="generic-clustering-methodology">

    2.1.2. Generic clustering methodology
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Clustering algorithms usually require the desired
   <strong>
    number of clusters
   </strong>
   to be set as a parameter. To estimate this parameter, there are several different approaches (Sharda et al., 2014, p. 181):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "Look at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters; that is, choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster would not give much better modeling of the data"
   </li>
   <li>
    Set the number of clusters to (n/2)
    <sup>
     1/2
    </sup>
    , where n is the number of data points"
   </li>
   <li>
    "Use the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which is a measure of the goodness of fit (based on the concept of entropy) to determine the number of clusters"
   </li>
   <li>
    "Use Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which is a model-selection criterion (based on maximum likelihood estimation)"
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   "Most cluster analysis methods involve the use of a
   <strong>
    distance measure
   </strong>
   to calculate the closeness between pairs of items. Popular distance measures include Euclidean distance (the ordinary distance between two points that one would measure with a ruler) and Manhattan distance (also called rectilinear distance, or taxicab distance, between two points). ... Weighted averages may be used to establish these distances" (Sharda et al., 2014, 182).

    Recompute the new cluster centers.
   </li>
   <li>

  </p>
  <p>
   Association rules have the following terms and notation:

   "Several algorithms are available for discovering association rules ... [they] do only half the job, which is to identify the frequent itemsets in the database. Once the frequent itemsets are identified, they need to be converted into rules with antecedent and consequent parts ... [which is] a straightforward matching process, but the process may be time-consuming with large transaction databases.

  <p>
   Even though there may be many items in each section of the rule, in practice the consequent part usually contains a single item" (Sharda et al., 2014, p. 184).

   "The
   <strong>
    area under the ROC curve
   </strong>
   is a graphical assessment technique where the true positive rate is plotted on the y-axis and the false positive rate is plotted on the x-axis. The area under the ROC curve determines the accuracy measure of a classifier: A value of 1 indicates a perfect classifier whereas 0.5 indicates no better than random chance" (Sharda et al., 2014, p. 175).

   Per Sharda et al. (2014, pp. 176-178):
  </p>

   "A tree consists of brances and nodes. A
   <em>
    branch
   </em>
   represents the outcome of a test to classify ... A
   <em>
    leaf node
   </em>
   at the end represents the final class choice ... The basic idea behind a decision tree is that it recursively divides a training set until each division consists entirely or primarily of examples from one class. Each non-leaf node of the tree contains a
   <em>
    split point,
   </em>
   which is a test on one or more attributes and determines how the data are to be divided further. Decision tree algorithms, in general, build an initial tree from the training data such that each leaf node is pure ["i.e., contains members of the same class ... The basic idea is to ask questions whose answers provide the most information, similar to what we may do when playing the game 'Twenty Questions'"], and they then prune the tree to increase its generalization, and hence, the prediction accuracy on test data ...
  </p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    Create a root node and assign all of the training data to it.
   </li>
   <li>
    Select the
    <em>
     best
    </em>
    splitting attribute.
   </li>
   <li>
    Add a branch to the root node for each value of the split. Split the data into mutually exclusive (nonoverlapping) subsets along the lines of the specific splits and mode to the branches.
   </li>
   <li>
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each and every leaf node until the stopping criteria is reached (e.g., the mode is dominated by a single class label).
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Many algorithms have been proposed for creating decision trees. These algorithms differ primarily in terms of the way in which they determine the splitting attribute (and its split values), the order of splitting the attributes (splitting the same attribute only once or many times), the number of splits at each node (binary versus ternary), the stopping criteria, and the pruning of the tree (pre- versus postpruning)."

   <li>
    From pattern recognition,
    <strong>
     CHAID
    </strong>
    (chi-squared automatic interaction detector)
   </li>
  </ul>
