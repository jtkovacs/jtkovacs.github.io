    1. What is design?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Herbert Simon's definition (1969, p. 55) of design as the “transformation of existing conditions into preferred ones” is very popular. Also, from the editor's introduction to Johan Redström's
   <em>
    Making design theory:
   </em>
   "All goods and services are designed. The urge to design --- to consider a situation, imagine a better situation, and act to create that improved situation --- goes back to our prehuman ancestors. Making tools helped us to become what we are --- design helped to make us human."
  </p>
  <p>
   Per Jaime Snyder at University of Washington, the purpose of a specific
   <strong>
    design intervention
   </strong>
   may be (1) to solve specific problems, OR (2) to help people reach their potential (more ambitious).

    2.1. What is good design?
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Rams (n.d.; an industrial designer), good design:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Is innovative
   </li>
   <li>
    Makes a product useful
   </li>
   <li>
    Is aesthetic
   </li>
   <li>
    Makes a product understandable
   </li>
   <li>
    Is unobtrusive
   </li>
   <li>
    Is honest
   </li>
   <li>
    Is long-lasting
   </li>
   <li>
    Is thorough
   </li>
   <li>
    Is environmentally-friendly
   </li>
   <li>
    Is as little design as possible
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Per Labarre (2018), it is:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Transparent
   </li>
   <li>
    Considers broad consequences
   </li>
   <li>
    Slow
   </li>
   <li>
    Honest
   </li>
   <li>
    Political
   </li>
   <li>
    Mindful of systems
   </li>
   <li>
    Good writing
   </li>
   <li>
    Multifaceted (pursuing a brand identity that is humerous, useful, beautiful, inspiring)
   </li>
   <li>
    Not risk-averse
   </li>
   <li>
    For people and machines (cyberagents)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Norman's fundamental principles of design (2013, p. 72):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Discoverability.
    </strong>
    It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Feedback.
    </strong>
    There is full and continuous information about the result of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Conceptual model.
    </strong>
    The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Affordances.
    </strong>
    The proper affordances exist to make the desired actions possible.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Signifiers.
    </strong>
    Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Mappings.
    </strong>
    The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Constraints.
    </strong>
    Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides action and eases interpretation."
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="human-centered-design">
   <a>
    2.1.1. Human-centered design
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Norman, a good design is
   <strong>
    human-centered design
   </strong>
   --- "an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first" (Norman, 2013, p. 8). It entails
   <strong>
    "starting with a good understanding of people
   </strong>
   and of the needs that the design is intended to meet". "This understanding comes about primarily through
   <strong>
    observation,
   </strong>
   for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering"; it also comes in the form of principles from psychology and HCI. Finally, the approach involves
   <strong>
    iteration
   </strong>
   --- "rapid tests of ideas ... after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition".
  </p>
  <h4 id="model-of-cognitive-processing">
   <a>
    2.1.1.1. Model of cognitive processing
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Norman's (2013) conceptual model of the brain involves three levels of processing, with emotion and cognition (conscious and subconscious) tightly interrelated. This model is presented at-length in his book
   <em>
    Emotional design.
   </em>
   Designers should consider how their product, service, process, etc. impacts each level of processing:
  </p>
  <h5 id="visceral-level">
   <a>
    2.1.1.1.1. Visceral level
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   <strong>
    "Visceral
   </strong>
   responses are fast and completely subconscious. They are sensitive only to the current state of things" (p. 51; see
   <a href="health.html#what-is-trauma">
    notes on trauma).
   </a>
   Emotions at this level are
   <em>
    reactions
   </em>
   of
   <strong>
    calmness and anxiety
   </strong>
   (p. 55).
  </p>
  <h5 id="behavioral-level">
   <a>
    2.1.1.1.2. Behavioral level
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   "The
   <strong>
    behavioural
   </strong>
   level is the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analysis at this level are largely subconscious. Even though we are usually aware of our actions, we are often unaware of the details ... all we have to do is think of the goal and the behavioral level handles all" (p. 51). Emotions at this level are pattern-based or intentional
   <em>
    expectations
   </em>
   of
   <strong>
    hope and fear,
   </strong>
   as well as outcomes-related emotions of
   <strong>
    relief or despair
   </strong>
   (p. 55).
  </p>
  <h5 id="reflective-level">
   <a>
    2.1.1.1.3. Reflective level
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   "The
   <strong>
    reflective
   </strong>
   level is the home of conscious cognition ... where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place ... Reflection is cognitive, deep, and slow. It often occurs after the events have happened ... [e.g.] adding causal elements to experienced events" (p. 53; see
   <a href="learning.html">
    notes on learning
   </a>
   and
   <a href="health.html#what-is-mindfulness">
    notes on mindfulness).

   Emotions at this level are
   <em>
    judgements
   </em>
   of

    satisfaction, pride, blame, anger, guilt, etc.

   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Signifier:
    </strong>
    "can be words, a graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affordances are unambiguous"; a signifier makes the object's affordances known to the agent (Norman, 2013, p. 19)

    2.1.1.3. Model of (inter)action
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Norman's (2013) model of action (relevant to
   <a href="productivity.html">
    productivity)
   </a>
   is also a model of interaction with a system (relevant to design).
  </p>
  <p>
   Between a person (processor) and the world are two gulfs:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Gulf of Execution:
    </strong>
    looking at an unfamiliar system or object, trying to figure out its affordances and the actions that will exercise them
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Gulf of Evaluation:
    </strong>
    "the amount of effort that a person must make to interpret the physical state of the device and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met" (p. 39)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To cross the Gulf of Execution, a person must:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Plan
    </strong>
    the action (different alternatives)
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Specify
    </strong>
    the action (what was chosen)
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Perform
    </strong>
    the action
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To cross the Gulf of Evaluation, a person must:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Perceive
    </strong>
    the system state
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Interpret
    </strong>
    the perception
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Compare
    </strong>
    the interpretation with the goal, perhaps leading to formation of a new goal
   </li>
  </ul>

   In this model, the agent may begin by forming a goal ("goal-driven behavior") or by reacting to the world ("data-" or "event-driven behavior"; pp. 42-43). Regardless, the agent is empowered to act by a robust, suggestive conceptual model, such as might come from
   <a href="management.html#systems-thinking">
    systems thinking,
   </a>
   and by depersonalizing the situation (as promoted by positive psychology) rather than blaming themselves (p. 37). This empowerment contrasts with a state of "learned" or "taught helpnessness" (p. 62).

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    current technological limitations
   </li>
   <li>
    self-imposed restrictions (he calls "cost" one of these, I think that's debatable)
   </li>
   <li>
    lack of understanding of HCI, because "Engineers are trained to think logically"

  </h3>
  <p>
   These are "dark patterns", coined and classified by Harry Brignall (n.d.):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Bait and Switch:
    </strong>
    You set out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Disguised Ads:
    </strong>
    Adverts that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get you to click on them.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Forced Continuity:
    </strong>
    When your free trial with a service comes to an end and your credit card silently starts getting charged without any warning. In some cases this is made even worse by making it difficult to cancel the membership.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Friend Spam:
    </strong>
    The product asks for your email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Hidden Costs:
    </strong>
    You get to the last step of the checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges have appeared, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Misdirection:
    </strong>
    The design purposefully focuses your attention on one thing in order to distract you attention from another.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Price Comparison Prevention:
    </strong>
    The retailer makes it hard for you to compare the price of an item with another item, so you cannot make an informed decision.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Privacy Zuckering:
    </strong>
    You are tricked into publicly sharing more information about yourself than you really intended to. Named after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Roach Motel:
    </strong>
    The design makes it very easy for you to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for you to get out of it (e.g. a subscription).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Sneak into Basket:
    </strong>
    You attempt to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into your basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Trick Questions:
    </strong>
    You respond to a question, which, when glanced upon quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks another thing entirely.

    3. Design thinking
   </a>

  <p>
   Design thinking is for generating ideas. It draws on user research/contextual inquiry; it contributes to
   <a href="https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/management.html#strategy">
    strategy
   </a>
   and
   <a href="https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/performance-management.html">
    performance management
   </a>
   as well as product and service design. Vassallo (2017b) urges the incorporation of
   <a href="management.html#systems-thinking">
    systems thinking
   </a>
   into design thinking, to cope with global complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Design thinking incorporates constituent or consumer insights in depth and rapid prototyping, all aimed at getting beyond the assumptions that block effective solutions. Design thinking —
   <strong>
    inherently optimistic, constructive, and experiential
   </strong>
   — addresses the needs of the people who will consume a product or service and the infrastructure that enables it. Businesses are embracing design thinking because it helps them be more innovative, better differentiate their brands, and bring their products and services to market faster. Nonprofits are beginning to use design thinking as well to develop better solutions to social problems. Design thinking crosses the traditional boundaries between public, for-profit, and nonprofit sectors. By working closely with the clients and consumers, design thinking allows high-impact solutions to bubble up from below rather than being imposed from the top" (Brown and Wyatt, 2010, p. 32).

   Keller (1983) credits Gordon (1961) for developing the concepts of divergent and convergent thinking under the banner of "synectics".

  <h2 id="empathy">
   <a>
    3.2. Empathy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   "'Empathy' was Ideo founder David Kelley’s shorthand for in-the-weeds ethnographic research. And, to be fair, that’s what some design thinkers still have in mind. But as design thinking has grown in popularity, some of its core tenets have been watered down or misapplied. Perhaps as a result of overuse, when most designers talk about empathy, they don’t seem to me to be referring to fact-gathering at all, but something more like feeling-broadcasting. Empathy in design has gone from an outward-facing action to an inward-turned affect. I think it might be too late to protect the design-thinking denotation of the word from the layman’s definition. Regardless, I would urge us as a discipline to practice rigorous evidence-based compassion, rather than trying to feel people’s pain" (Vassallo, 2017a).

  <p>
   "The design thinking process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps. There are three spaces to keep in mind: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Think of
   <strong>
    inspiration
   </strong>
   as the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions;
   <strong>
    ideation
   </strong>
   as the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas; and
   <strong>
    implementation
   </strong>
   as the path that leads from the project stage into people’s lives." (Brown and Wyatt, 2010, p. 33)
