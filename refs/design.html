    1. What is design?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Herbert Simon's definition (1969, p. 55) of design as the “transformation of existing conditions into preferred ones” is very popular. Also, from the editor's introduction to Johan Redström's
   <em>
    Making design theory:
   </em>
   "All goods and services are designed. The urge to design --- to consider a situation, imagine a better situation, and act to create that improved situation --- goes back to our prehuman ancestors. Making tools helped us to become what we are --- design helped to make us human."
  </p>
  <p>
   Per Jaime Snyder at University of Washington, the purpose of a specific
   <strong>
    design intervention
   </strong>
   may be (1) to solve specific problems, OR (2) to help people reach their potential (more ambitious).

  <p>
   Per Rams (n.d.; an industrial designer), good design:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Is innovative
   </li>
   <li>
    Makes a product useful
   </li>
   <li>

   <li>
    Makes a product understandable

   <li>

   <li>
    Is environmentally-friendly
   </li>
   <li>
    Is as little design as possible
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Per Labarre (2018), it is:
  </p>
  <ul>

    2.1.1. Human-centered design
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Norman, a good design is a design that addresses the two Gulfs --- of Execution, via feedforward information from the system, and of Evaluation, via feedback. He calls this
   <strong>
    human-centered design
   </strong>
   --- "an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first" (Norman, 2013, p. 8). It entails:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "starting with a good understanding of people" (general HCI principles) "and of the needs that the design is intended to meet" (user research)
   </li>
   <li>
    "This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering"
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, the approach includes "rapid tests of ideas ... after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition"
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  </h2>
  <p>
   These are "dark patterns", coined and classified by Harry Brignall (n.d.):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Bait and Switch:
    </strong>
    You set out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Disguised Ads:
    </strong>
    Adverts that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get you to click on them.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Forced Continuity:
    </strong>
    When your free trial with a service comes to an end and your credit card silently starts getting charged without any warning. In some cases this is made even worse by making it difficult to cancel the membership.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Friend Spam:
    </strong>
    The product asks for your email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Hidden Costs:
    </strong>
    You get to the last step of the checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges have appeared, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Misdirection:
    </strong>
    The design purposefully focuses your attention on one thing in order to distract you attention from another.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Price Comparison Prevention:
    </strong>
    The retailer makes it hard for you to compare the price of an item with another item, so you cannot make an informed decision.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Privacy Zuckering:
    </strong>
    You are tricked into publicly sharing more information about yourself than you really intended to. Named after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Roach Motel:
    </strong>
    The design makes it very easy for you to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for you to get out of it (e.g. a subscription).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Sneak into Basket:
    </strong>
    You attempt to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into your basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Trick Questions:
    </strong>
    You respond to a question, which, when glanced upon quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks another thing entirely.

    3. Design thinking

  <p>
   Design thinking is for generating ideas. It draws on user research/contextual inquiry; it contributes to
   <a href="https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/management.html#strategy">
    strategy
   </a>
   and
   <a href="https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/performance-management.html">
    performance management
   </a>
   as well as product and service design. Vassallo (2017b) urges the incorporation of
   <a href="management.html#systems-thinking">
    systems thinking
   </a>
   into design thinking, to cope with global complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Design thinking incorporates constituent or consumer insights in depth and rapid prototyping, all aimed at getting beyond the assumptions that block effective solutions. Design thinking —
   <strong>
    inherently optimistic, constructive, and experiential
   </strong>
   — addresses the needs of the people who will consume a product or service and the infrastructure that enables it. Businesses are embracing design thinking because it helps them be more innovative, better differentiate their brands, and bring their products and services to market faster. Nonprofits are beginning to use design thinking as well to develop better solutions to social problems. Design thinking crosses the traditional boundaries between public, for-profit, and nonprofit sectors. By working closely with the clients and consumers, design thinking allows high-impact solutions to bubble up from below rather than being imposed from the top" (Brown and Wyatt, 2010, p. 32).

  <p>
   Keller (1983) credits Gordon (1961) for developing the concepts of divergent and convergent thinking under the banner of "synectics".
  </p>
  <h2 id="empathy">
   <a>
    3.2. Empathy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   "'Empathy' was Ideo founder David Kelley’s shorthand for in-the-weeds ethnographic research. And, to be fair, that’s what some design thinkers still have in mind. But as design thinking has grown in popularity, some of its core tenets have been watered down or misapplied. Perhaps as a result of overuse, when most designers talk about empathy, they don’t seem to me to be referring to fact-gathering at all, but something more like feeling-broadcasting. Empathy in design has gone from an outward-facing action to an inward-turned affect. I think it might be too late to protect the design-thinking denotation of the word from the layman’s definition. Regardless, I would urge us as a discipline to practice rigorous evidence-based compassion, rather than trying to feel people’s pain" (Vassallo, 2017a).

   "The design thinking process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps. There are three spaces to keep in mind: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Think of
   <strong>
    inspiration
   </strong>
   as the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions;
   <strong>
    ideation
   </strong>
   as the process of generating, developing, and testing ideas; and
   <strong>
    implementation
   </strong>
   as the path that leads from the project stage into people’s lives." (Brown and Wyatt, 2010, p. 33)
