    1. What is information retrieval?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   IR occurs when a user retrieves information objects AKA content objects (documents and metadata) from an information retrieval system (e.g. libraries, archives, repositories/portals, websites, databases).
   <a href="#what-is-information-architecture?">
    IR requires IA.

   <li>
    Svenonius (2005): "Systems that do not employ vocabulary control may be characterized in terms of their indexing: natural language, derived, keyword, or title word indexing; or, in terms of the type of searching they allow: free-text searching or full-text searching. It is not a foregone conclusion that a system with vocabulary control is better than one without it."

  <p>
   Information professionals work to ensure that IR (1) has good
   <strong>
    precision,
   </strong>
   AKA 'satisfies the requirement for general survey' or 'satisfies the collocating requirement' or attains 'representational predictability'; (2) has
   <strong>
    good recall;
   </strong>
   and (3) is
   <a href="#interoperability">
    possible across multiple IR systems.
   </a>
   They do this by (1)
   <a href="search-engines.html">
    creating search algorithms
   </a>
   or by (2) ingesting information objects into a catalog, which includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      CATALOGING
     </strong>
     the object, i.e. describing/representing an information object with metadata, including subject headings and subheadings. Subject headings and subheadings can be combined from the beginning (precoordination) or combined by users while searching (postcoordination)
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Assigning subject headings (called "subject cataloging") entails
      <strong>
       CLASSIFYING
      </strong>
      objects. "In LIS, the term 'classification' is used to refer to three distinct but related concepts: a system of classes, ordered according to a predetermined set of principles and used to organize a set of entities; a group or class in a classification system; and the process of assigning entities to classes in a classification system" (Jacob, 2004, p.522).
     </li>
     <li>
      The first sense of classification given here (constructing classes) may also be called
      <strong>
       CATEGORIZATION,
      </strong>
      although categories are perhaps less strict than classes. "Categorization is the process of dividing the world into groups of entities whose members are in some way similar to each ... By reducing the load on memory and facilitating the efficient storage and retrieval of information, categorization serves as the fundamental cognitive mechanism that simplifies the individual’s experience of the environment" (Jacob, 2004, p. 518).
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      INDEXING
     </strong>
     the object, i.e. mapping out the contents of an information object, perhaps using terms from a CV (at minimum, for named entities, an authority file should be consulted).
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Although
       <strong>
        TAGGING
       </strong>
       or keywording is occasionally used as a synonym for indexing, it is more often used to denote the opposite of indexing, in which keywords emerge from an information itself rather than from an indexing language. This allows for a grassroots view of what something is about.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      Indexing may be performed by machines when it is
      <strong>
       necessary
      </strong>
      (there are many documents; content changes quickly; speed matters) or when it is
      <strong>
       suitable
      </strong>
      (documents are inherently structured; documents fall within a small domain; documents are only text).
      <ul>
       <li>
        Automatic indexing with a CV (AKA auto-tagging, -classification, -categorization) may be rules-based (e.g., using regex) or machine learning-based (Bayesian, support vector machines, neural networks). Regardless, performance is better with pre-coordinated terms.
       </li>
       <li>
        Automatic indexing that doesn't use a CV is called information extraction, which includes
        <strong>
         entity extraction
        </strong>
        AKA entity recognition, entity identification.
        <br/>
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Indexing may be performed by humans (professionals or social media users) when it is
      <strong>
       necessary
      </strong>
      (accuracy matters more than speed; must index nontext objects; content lacks inherent structure; content varies greatly) or
      <strong>
       feasible
      </strong>
      (few documents).
      <ul>
       <li>
        Human professional indexing consists of
        <ul>
         <li>
          analyzing content;
         </li>
         <li>
          assigning terms; and possibly
         </li>
         <li>
          assigning relevancy scores/weights to the terms.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        Human social indexing produced a
        <strong>
         folksonomy,
        </strong>
        different from the anthropological term "folk taxonomy" that describes informal categorization schemes.

   To retrieve information, users engage with information systems by:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      SEARCHING
     </strong>
     for a specific piece of information; this is the concern of back-end IA. Simultaneous search of multiple information systems is called metasearching, broadcast searching, cross-database searching, federated searching, and parallel searching.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BROWSING
     </strong>
     a collection of information; this is the concern of front-end IA, with the goal of intuitive user interfaces and navigational structures. Browsing is "quick examination of the relevance of a number of objects which may or may not lead to a closer examination or acquisition/selection of (some of) these objects" Hjørland (2011); "visually scanning through organized collections of representations of content objects" (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005, p. 157).

    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       NAVIGATION

      is related to browsing, but has implications of (1) traversing a website (2) via "pre-established links or relationships" (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005, p. 162).

The "finding" dimension of IA is information retrieval, the legacy of library science; the "understanding" dimension comes via Richard Saul Wurman, who focused on making complex systems intelligible through visualization.

   Per Abrahamson and Freedman (2008), order (like all things) has both benefit and cost. Even setting feasibility aside, it's probably never the case that 100% order is
   <em>
    optimal.
   </em>
   At the same time, because individuals' organization strategies and preferences vary so much, shared information spaces must (?) be organized according to intelligible principles that prospective users of the space can access and learn.

   Hedden (2016) offers a typology in which taxonomies (i.e., knowledge organization structures) have different bases/origins. KOSs may be (1) objective, with obvious empirical basis; (2) socially-negotiated, perhaps eventually becoming (3) culturally embedded; or (4) idiosyncratic:

   Schemas and structures work together. For example, my Zotero library is a hierarchy (structure) of topical categories (schema), automatically sorted by alphabet (schema). The distinction I draw is that "schemas" are for the conceptual (abstract, disembodied) organization of information into groups, whereas "structures" describe group configuration.

   Wurman (1990) claims there are only five ways to organize items. Similarly, Wyllys (2000) states that information can be organized according to different schemas that encompass Wurman's five ways (italicized):

  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Exact schemas

    <strong>
     Inexact schemas,

    <em>
     categories:

    topical, task-oriented, audience-specific, metaphor-driver (e.g., information lifecycle)

    3. What is taxonomy?
   </a>
  </h1>
  <p>
   Per Hedden, taxonomy --- the law or science (nomos) of order (taxis) --- has both general and specific meanings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, taxonomy is the discipline of creating and managing taxonomies, a term synonymous with knowledge organization structures/systems (KOS) and very nearly synonymous with controlled vocabularies (CVs). As a field, taxonomy has roots in biological taxonomies and library catalogs (which existed even in antiquity as scrolls). Companies began to use taxonomies for corporate knowledge asset management very marginally in the 1980s, then increasingly in the 1990s as web technologies spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond this general sense, taxonomies are also

    specific kinds of KOSs.

    Term lists
   </strong>
   are essentially flat list, though they may include "See"/"Use" to steer people towards preferred language, or use a synonym ring approach (no preferred term among multiple).
  </p>

   <li>
    <strong>

    </a>
    (vocabulary, clavis, specialized dictionary): An alphabetical list of terms with definitions inside a particular domain of knowledge.

   <li>
    <strong>
     Stop list:
    </strong>
    Words to ignore in search query processing (because they are extremely common)
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Dictionary:
    </strong>
    Definitions, history, etc. for words.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Gazetteer:
    </strong>
    A geographical dictionary
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Synonym rings
   </strong>
   AKA synsets associate synonyms without indicating preference for one over the others (equivalence relationship). Synsets are usually invisible to users, e.g. underpinning a search engine.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Taxonomies
   </strong>
   AKA hierarchies AKA hierarchical taxonomies AKA tree structures arrange terms into parent/child relationships beneath a single top term (TT). A strict hierarchy requires that each term have a single parent AKA broader term (BT), though they may have multiple siblings and children AKA narrower terms (NT).
  </p>
  <p>
   Indexing a content object with a term is called posting; a given term contains X postings. The practice of indexing a content object with a broader term rather than a narrower term is called generic posting. If, instead, the content object is indexed with narrower and broader terms, this is called up-posting AKA autoposting. Generic posting also means subsuming narrower terms under a preferred broader term in a controlled vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taxonomies are a top-down approach. Thus, there may occasionally be node labels AKA blind references AKA facet indicators: terms in a CV that are never applied to a content object, but exist to preserve a coherent logical structure or to expose the logic behind choices made.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Microcontrolled vocabularies
   </strong>
   are subsets of a controlled vocabulary, creating a specialist CV.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Faceted taxonomies
   </strong>
   are a bottom-up approach to providing multiple views of the same content objects, based on shared attributes like topic, location, format, author, etc. They are often presented as navigation aids or search refinments; they may also be used to organize very large controlled vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Polyhierarchies
   </strong>
   are hierarchies in which children may have multiple parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Thesauri
   </strong>
   capture associative relationships AKA related terms (RT) in addition to equivalence (U/UF) and hierarchical (BT/NT) relationships. Relationships are also called cross-references; they should be reciprocal (explicit entry at term Y linking to term X, explicit entry at term X linking to term Y) and may or may not be symmetric. Thesauri are useful for representing a very large controlled vocabulary.

   Controlled vocabularies stand in contrast with natural languages, which undermine information retrieval because they are fraught with polysemes* (ambiguous words --- both homographs and synonyms/near-synonyms/quasi-synonyms). At minimum, to avoid the IR pitfalls of natural languages CVs must:
  </p>

   Since warrants shift over time, there should be a 'parking lot' for candidate terms AKA provisional terms. Terms can be generated by a committee (top-down, bottom-up); by empirical methods (deductive, inductive); by a machine; or from an existing CV (don't duplicate effort!).

  </h5>
  <p>
   The basic rule per ANSI/NISO Z39.19 is that a term should denote a single
   <strong>
    concept
   </strong>
   or unit of thought; this is challenged by Svenonius (2005), who argues that concepts are inherently fuzzy and that quantitative linguistics provides a more objective foundation for extracting terms from natural language. At any rate, there are different kinds of concepts:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Things and their parts
   </li>
   <li>
    Materials
   </li>
   <li>
    Activities, processes
   </li>
   <li>
    Events, occurrences
   </li>
   <li>
    Properties, qualities, states
   </li>
   <li>
    Disciplines, fields
   </li>
   <li>
    Units of measurement
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The simplest term form is a
   <strong>
    single-word term;
   </strong>
   there are several kinds of multiword AKA
   <strong>
    compound terms,
   </strong>
   the construction of which is governed by the CV's
   <strong>
    syntax:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (1)
   </span>
   <strong>
    bound term
   </strong>
   uses multiple words or a phrase to denote a single concept, e.g.
   <em>
    oral surgery.
   </em>
   The inverted form of bound terms may be included as an entry term, e.g.
   <em>
    surgery, oral: see oral surgery.
   </em>
   These
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (a)
   </span>
   naturally occurring compound terms are generally preferable to
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (b)
   </span>
   <strong>
    qualified homographs
   </strong>
   --- for example,
   <em>
    religious tolerance
   </em>
   is generally better than
   <em>
    tolerance (religious).
   </em>
   If no bound compound term exists, ambiguous terms (AKA head or focus nouns) should receive a modifier (AKA difference). Additionally, the scope of any term, not just homographs, may be clarified with a scope note (SN). If a SN mentions another term in the vocabulary, it should receive a reciprocal SN or cross-reference:
   <em>
    term2: X SN term1.
   </em>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Try to standardize qualifiers (e.g., don't have
    <em>
     biology
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     bioscience
    </em>
    both as qualifiers)
   </li>
   <li>
    The qualifier must not itself be a homograph
   </li>
   <li>
    The addition of a qualifier must not make the term a compound concept
   </li>
   <li>
    Qualify even the domain-specific dominant use of a term
   </li>
   <li>
    Qualify even if only one use of the homograph occurs in the CV
    <ul>
     <li>
      ... unless other meanings of the homograph are entirely outside the domain
      <ul>
       <li>
        ... but even then, anticipate metasearching and include a qualifier
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While compound terms denote a single concept,
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (2)
   </span>
   <strong>
    coordinated terms
   </strong>
   AKA synthesized terms associate several concepts with a single information object and generally fall in the domain of indexing languages. Coordinated terms can be
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (a)
   </span>
   embedded in the object
   <strong>
    (precoordination),
   </strong>
   as with Library of Congress subject headings in books:
   <em>
    English Language--Rhetoric, Persuasion (Rhetoric), Report Writing.
   </em>
   Precoordinated terms enable browsing with great specificity, describe complex concepts, and impose alphabetic proximity on related terms that would otherwise be far apart. Given the high cost of taxonomist labor, though, it's often better to let users
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
    (b)
   </span>
   combine terms interactively during search
   <strong>
    (postcoordination),
   </strong>
   e.g.
   <em>
    English Language AND Rhetoric AND Persuasion AND Report Writing.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Use of a compound term should be determined by warrant, total #terms in the CV (more compound terms means more overall terms), and intended format (print sometimes benefits from precoordinated terms); see ANSI/NISO Z9.19 pp. 39-40 for more guidance and examples.

       </li>
       <li>
        Avoid postmodified/prepositional noun phrases unless idiomatic, e.g. avoid
        <em>
         hospitals for children
        </em>
        in favor of
        <em>
         children's hospital,

        but prefer

         proof's burden
        </em>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Avoid verbs used as nouns; e.g., prefer
      <em>
       reading
      </em>
      to
      <em>
       read,
      </em>

     <li>
      Single adjectives are sometimes included:

        ... to facilitate coordination and avoid multiple compound terms, e.g.
        <em>
         small, portable, offshore
        </em>
       </li>
       <li>
        ... as an entry term, e.g.
        <em>
         cardiac: see also terms beginning with heart
        </em>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Single adverbs are rarely needed, but depends on the domain
     </li>
     <li>

    <strong>
     Pluralization:
    </strong>
    <ul>

      Count nouns (how many?) should be plural unless the singular form is common in the domain
     </li>
     <li>
      Mass nouns (how much?) should be singular unless users regard the noun as a class with &gt;1 member
     </li>
     <li>
      Regardless, abstract concepts and unique entities are singular
     </li>
     <li>
      Singular and plural forms of a noun may denote different concepts, so both may appear (qualified) in the CV
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <span style="color:red;">
    *Svenonius (2005)
   </span>
   explains the intended effect of this standard: CVs where every term is "context independent", i.e. self-contained and thus reusable. However, context independence is "not normally operative in classification schemes where the verbal headings are governed by the principle of hierarchical force."

    3.4. Interoperability
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per ANSI/NISO Z39.19, the need for interoperability arises from different sources:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Users want to metasearch across different IR systems
   </li>
   <li>
    Users are multilingual
    <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/12159.html">
     (see ISO 5964)
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    Two databases, indexed differently, must be merged
   </li>
   <li>
    A content object must be indexed with a CV developed for a different domain
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Interoperability may be approached in different ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Combine CVs
   </li>
   <li>
    Create a micro CV
   </li>
   <li>
    Create a map/crosswalk between CVs
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Interoperability data may be stored in:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Authority records
   </li>
   <li>
    Vocabulary mappings
   </li>
   <li>
    Semantic networks
   </li>
   <li>
    Lexical databases, e.g. WordNet
   </li>
  </ul>
