# What is data?

The **DIKW pyramid** differentiates the terms data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in an interesting way: data is raw, information is contextualized data, knowledge is internalized information (which is then re-externalized through [knowledge management]()); wisdom is knowledge that is refined and applied with good judgement. I like to think about the amount and kind of human effort that goes into each conversion.

From the perspective of computers, data is inside a file AKA document; files are inside directories AKA folders; and directories are organized hierarchically in the directory tree AKA file system.



# What is data management?

- Data movement
- Storage
    - Databases
    - Data warehouses
    - Data lakes
