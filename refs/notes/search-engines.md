## How do search engines work?

In general, search engines work by crawling and [automatically indexing](information-architecture.html#cataloging-&-indexing) content (thus creating metadata). This index may be fairly shallow, e.g. based on contents of the <meta> tag or headers; it may also be quite deep, using natural language process (NLP) techniques like grammatical stemming. User search terms are then matched to the index.

In the early days, there was a strong distinction between search engines and library catalogs; increasingly, though, [KOSs from IA](information-architecture.html#koss-by-role-in-ir) may play a role.
