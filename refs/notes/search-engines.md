# How do search engines work?

In general, search engines work by crawling and [automatically indexing](information-architecture.html#cataloging-&-indexing) content, thus creating metadata. This index may be fairly shallow, e.g. based on contents of the <meta> tag or headers; it may also be quite deep, using natural language process (NLP) techniques like grammatical stemming. User search terms are then matched to the index.

In the early days, there was a strong distinction in techniques used between search engines and library catalogs. Increasingly, though, [KOSs from IA](information-architecture.html#koss-by-role-in-ir) --- which take advantage of human knowledge by formalizing it for use by an information system --- play a role in improve search engine performance.
