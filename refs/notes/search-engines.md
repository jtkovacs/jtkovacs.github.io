# What are search engines?

"Technically, 'search engine' is the popular term for information retrieval systems. Although Web search engines are the most popular, search engines are often used in other than the Web, such as desktop search engines and document search engines ... perhaps a more appropriate name for them would have been _finding engines"_ (Sharda et al., 2014, p. 243).

# How do search engines work?

In general, search engines work by crawling and [automatically indexing](information-architecture.html#cataloging-&-indexing) content, thus creating metadata. This index may be fairly shallow, e.g. based on contents of the <meta> tag or headers; it may also be quite deep, using natural language process (NLP) techniques like grammatical stemming. User search terms are then matched to the index.

In the early days, there was a strong distinction in techniques used between search engines and library catalogs. Increasingly, though, [KOSs from IA](information-architecture.html#koss-by-role-in-ir) --- which take advantage of human knowledge by formalizing it for use by an information system --- play a role in improving search engine performance.




## Search engine process

Per Sharda et al. (2014, pp. 243-

- **Token** "a categorized block of text in a sentence ... this assignment of meaning to blocks of text is known as **tokenizing"**

### Development cycle

### Response cycle




## Measuring search engine performance

Per Sharda et al. (2014):

- Effectiveness AKA quality of results
    -  Recall
    -  Precision
- Efficiency AKA speed




## Major search algorithms

### PageRank

### Hilltop

### Topic-Sensitive

### Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search

(or Hypertext Induced Topic Selection??)

### Panda

### Penguin

### Hummingbird

(semantic reasoning and query rewriting)

### RankBrain

(machine learning)
