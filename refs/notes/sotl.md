# Core terms

Per Booth (2011), a *learning interaction* happens between student, teacher, and *learning objects* within an *educational scenario* (“context and environment”). Learning objects are created by the teacher; educational scenarios established; and [instructional messages](#instructional-messages) crafted in line with [targets.](#targets)



# Skills for teaching

Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:

- capacity for **reflective practice** (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
- knowledge of **educational theory,** consisting of
    - **learning theory** (how people learn)
    - **instructional theory** (how to teach), and 
    - **curriculum theory** (content- and audience-specific considerations); 
- mastery of **teaching technologies** (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
- integration of the prior three items, i.e. skill in **instructional design**

## Qualities of excellent teachers

Per Booth (2011):

- authenticity, personal investment
- interpersonal connection, humor
- organization, goal-orientation




# Reflective practice

Per Booth (2011), a miscellany of advice regarding beliefs and attitudes:

- Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching




# Educational theory


## Learning theory

### The role of motivation

Per Keller (1983), motivation an extremely important part of learning. 


## Instructional theory

### Instructional messages

Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:

- get attention, hold interest: **UNEXPECTED, STORIES,** clearly relevant, clearly actionable
- facilitate comprehension: **SIMPLE, CONCRETE**
- appeal and persuade: **CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL**

### Targets

Per Booth (2011), targets “allow you to structure measurable learning interactions” and “improve the impact of instruction, particularly when participants have had a hand in defining them”. Targets form a hierarchy:

- OUTCOMES = hoped-for lasting changes
- GOALS = express a theory of how to produce outcomes
- OBJECTIVES = strategies/skills needed to attain goals
