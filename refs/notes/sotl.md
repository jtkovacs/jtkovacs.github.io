# Core terms

Per Booth (2011), a *learning interaction* happens between student, teacher, and *learning objects* within an *educational scenario* (“context and environment”). Learning objects are created by the teacher; educational scenarios established; and [instructional messages](#instructional-messages) crafted in line with [targets.](#targets)



# Elements of instructional literacy

Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:

- capacity for **reflective practice** (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
- knowledge of **educational theory,** consisting of
    - **learning theory** (how people learn)
    - **instructional theory** (how to teach), and 
    - **curriculum theory** (content- and audience-specific considerations); 
- mastery of **teaching technologies** (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
- integration and application of the prior three items, i.e. skill in **instructional design**





# Reflective practice

Per Booth (2011), a miscellany of advice regarding beliefs and attitudes:

- Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching




# Educational theory

## How does educational theory draw on relevant sciences?

Per Keller (1983):

- **Behavioral psychology** --> feedback and reinforcement
- **Cognitive psychology** re: info processing --> "how to organize instruction" for "acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills"
    - "also studied in relation to individual differences in ability and learning style"
- [Motivation](#motivation)

## Branches of educational theory

### Learning theory

#### Motivation theory

Per Keller (1983), motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is *why* people learn, rather than *how.* He says that: 

- In keeping with field theory/social learning theory, B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person, **B=f(E,P);**
- As categories of Behavior, is important to distinguish between:
    - Effort = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation"
    - Performance = f(motivation,ability,opportunity)
    - Consequences = Performance + (benefits to the individual = motivation)
- Determinants E and P may be examined for each Behavior *with a focus on Motivation* to identify instructional strategies:

### Instructional theory

#### Qualities of excellent teachers

Per Booth (2011):

- authenticity, personal investment
- interpersonal connection, humor
- organization, goal-orientation

#### Instructional messages

Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:

- get attention, hold interest: **UNEXPECTED, STORIES,** clearly relevant, clearly actionable
- facilitate comprehension: **SIMPLE, CONCRETE**
- appeal and persuade: **CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL**

#### Targets

Per Booth (2011), targets “allow you to structure measurable learning interactions” and “improve the impact of instruction, particularly when participants have had a hand in defining them”. Targets form a hierarchy:

- OUTCOMES = hoped-for lasting changes
- GOALS = express a theory of how to produce outcomes
- OBJECTIVES = strategies/skills needed to attain goals








# Instructional design

## Teaching technologies

## Motivation design

Per Keller (1983), motivational design should address:

- **Interest** = f(curiosity,presentation) 
    - **Simulate** curiosity = f(novelty,paradox,incongruity,complexity)
        - Perceptual vs. *epistemic curiosity*
        - Trait vs. *state curiosity*
    - **Sustain** curiosity:
        - Allowance to explore
        - Lower the cost of failure
- **Relevance** = f(alignment,clear_connections)
- **Expectancy** = f(challenge,support), similar to "zone of proximal development"
- **Satisfaction** = f(intrinsic_reinforcement,extrinsic_reinforcement)
