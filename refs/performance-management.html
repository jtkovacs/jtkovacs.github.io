  <p>
   Per Sharda et al. (2014), BPM is also called corporate performance management (CPM), enterprise performance management (EPM), and strategic enterprise management (SEM). Performance management relates to the core managerial activity of

   Sharda et al. (2014, p. 131) cite Eckerson (2009) on the properties of KPIs:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Strategy:
    </strong>
    KPIs embody a strategic objective.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Targets:
    </strong>
    KPIs measure performance against specific targets. Targets are defined in strategy, planning, or budget sessions and can take different forms (e.g., achievment targets, reduction targets, absolute targets).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Ranges:
    </strong>
    Targets have performance ranges (e.g., above, on, or below target).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Encodings:
    </strong>
    Ranges are encoded in software, enabling the visual display of performance (e.g., green, yellow, red). Encodings can be based on percentages or more complex rules.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Time frames:
    </strong>
    Targets are assigned time frames by which they must be accomplished. A time frame is often divided into smaller intervals to provide performance mileposts.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Benchmarks.

   Per Sharda et al. (2014), the balanced scorecard approach to performance management was developed in 1992 by Kaplan and Norton. They quote: "Central to the BSC methodology is a holistic vision of a measurement system tied to the strategic direction of the organization. It is based on a four-perspective view of the [business] world" (p. 132), in which the "nonfinancial objectives [perspectives] form a simple causal chain [or ***strategy map]*** with
   <strong>
    'learning and growth'

   driving
   <strong>

    'customer'

   outcomes that are responsible for reaching a company's

    3.1.1. Flow diagram

  <p>
   Business processes underlie performance. One way to measure them: graph flow units vs. time, showing cumulative inflow and cumulative outflow. Then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    (Instantaneous) inventory is the vertical distance between c.inflow and c.outflow
   </li>
   <li>
    Flow time is the horizontal distance between c.inflow and c.outflow—the time a flow unit spends in the system
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Create a process flow diagram aka value stream map showing how flow units are transformed from inputs to outputs by process activities. Represent wait times, lines, or inventories with triangles, and activities with boxes (labeled with activity time in units, and m, the number of workers or resources). Then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Processing time is the sum of all the individual activity times
   </li>
   <li>
    Capacity is driven by processing time: m/processing time
   </li>
   <li>
    The bottleneck is the activity with lowest capacity, and this lowest capacity is the overall process capacity
   </li>
   <li>
    Flow rate aka throughput is min{demand_rate, process_capacity}, so flow rate is driven by these factors
   </li>
   <li>
    Utilization is flow_rate/capacity (dimensionless)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Realistically, processing times will vary from flow unit to flow unit. Flow units may even follow different pathways through all possible process activities. So, how to find the bottleneck and determine the flow rate? Depict multiple flow units on same process diagram, symbolized as types of flow units, then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Approach #1, “adding up demand streams”: (1) Compute capacity of each process activity: m/activity_time (2) Compute demand experienced by each activity (3) Compute implied utilization as ratio of demand to capacity (can sum to more than 100%); now, the activity with highest implied utilization is the bottleneck
   </li>
   <li>
    Approach #2, “minutes of work”: (1) Based on m, how many minutes of work per hour can each activity supply? (2) Calculate how many minutes of work is required by each demand stream (3) Compute ratio of minutes required to minutes available; highest is the bottleneck

   Why focus on this when labor seems to contribute less to modern firms’ costs? —because many firms keep labor costs off their balance sheet by ‘outsourcing’ them to their suppliers. If you account for labor in the cost of goods supplied, the role of labor becomes evident.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Labor content: sum of all the individual activity times
   </li>
   <li>
    Cycle time: 1/flow_rate
   </li>
   <li>
    All activities except the bottleneck have idle time=cycle_time-process_time, and the sum of these is direct idle time
   </li>
   <li>
    Average labor utilization is labor_content / (labor_content+direct_idle_time)
   </li>
   <li>

   Motivating question here is why should there be inventory? What are the drivers of inventory? (Note that, per Little’s law, these same factors are implicit drivers of flow time.) Contrast McDonald’s and Subway—not all companies use inventory to increase flow rate; there are make-to-stock vs. make-to-order strategies.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The reason is variability of activity times; workers do not “work like robots”, so “buffer or suffer”.
   </li>
   <li>
    Reasons for inventory: buffer seasonal demand, internal demand (between processes or activities), customer demand, inherent time lag in production (e.g., aging cheese).

    Activity yield is %units produced according to specification = 1 - p(defect)

    Swiss Cheese model: think of a hole as a defect; as you stack slices of cheese, there is always the chance that all the holes will line up. This redundancy reduces the probability of process failure. Then the process yield is 1-p(defect)

  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Adding representations of quality to a flow diagram:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Dropped flow units: Calculate end demand; calculate yield of each step (include defects); calculate how much each step must produce to meet demand (e.g., a 50% defect rate means that an activity must produce 2xD); calculate implied utilization (D/capacity); highest implied utilization is the bottleneck.
     </li>
     <li>
      Re-worked flow units: Calculate the expected processing time. E.g. if there is a 30% defect rate and defects are re-worked, then the real processing time is 0.7
      <em>
       processing_time + 0.3
      </em>
      rework_time. After this modification, the activity with lowest capacity is the bottleneck.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Costs of defects: Say that we pay $2 per flow unit as an input, but receive $20 per flow unit post-processing, as an output. Then the cost of defects depends not on where they occur, but where they are detected—before or after the bottleneck. Before is cheaper. Pre-bottleneck, defect costs are driven by input costs; post-bottleneck, by revenue (opportunity cost).
   </li>
   <li>
    Variability &amp; buffering dilemma:
    <ul>
     <li>
      For a 2-step process where each step has p(defect)=0.5, there are four possibilities: both defect-free; first step defective, leaving step 2 “starved”; second step defective, leaving step one “blocked”; and both defective. This variability dramatically lowers the expected flow rate; by adding a buffer, the flow rate may be increased.
     </li>
     <li>
      However, buffers remove the incentive for process improvement; buffering hides problems.
     </li>
     <li>
      Toyota developed the Kanban “demand-pull” card system to manage this dilemma. Kanban cards authorize work, and are themselves authorized by customer demand. This puts a cap on inventory.

    Capability score (AKA CP score), where higher is better: (USL-LSL)/(6*process_stdev). Clearly, the CP score can be raised by widening the range between upper and lower specifications, or by decreasing the standard deviation in the process.
