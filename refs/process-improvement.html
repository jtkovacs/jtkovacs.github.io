   <a>
    1.1. Business process automation (BPA)
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   BPA is focused on making current processes more efficient through automation; it requires thorough analysis of the current system.
  </p>
  <h3 id="problem-analysis">
   <a>
    1.1.1. Problem analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This entails asking current system users about problems they face or features they desire. Problems identified with this technique are often related to UI and their resolution produces little if any business value.
  </p>
  <h3 id="root-cause-analysis">
   <a>
    1.1.2. Root cause analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This entails asking current system users to explore the root causes of problems they've identified (since these problems may only be symptoms). Root causes may be uncovered by asking "Why?" five times; causal relationships may be represented as a hierarchy, web, or fishbone/Ishikawa diagram.
  </p>
  <h2 id="business-process-improvement-bpi">
   <a>
    1.2. Business process improvement (BPI)
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   BPI goes beyond increased efficiency to the realm of increased effectiveness, for instance taking advantage of new opportunities and technologies.
  </p>
  <h3 id="duration-analysis">
   <a>
    1.2.1. Duration analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   First, major processes are timed; second, all individual steps in those processes are timed. If the sum of step durations is smaller than the overall duration, this indicates a need for improvement --- which may be achieved through
   <strong>
    integration
   </strong>
   (fewer people involved in doing the work across its lifecycle) or
   <strong>
    parallelization
   </strong>
   (steps being done concurrently).

   Steps in a process are costed, and improvement efforts are focused on the costliest step.

    1.3. Business process reengineering (BPR)
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   BPR is a radical upending of current business processes and systems, so spends little time analyzing them. Per Rigby (2015; also gives recommendations for further reading), a BPR effort focuses on:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Reorienting organizational culture towards user needs
   </li>
   <li>
    Reorganizing traditional functional departments into cross-functional teams
   </li>
   <li>
    Redesigning and improving core processes, perhaps using IT to:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Reduce costs, waste, and cycle times
     </li>
     <li>
      Increase quality
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="outcome-analysis">
   <a>
    1.3.1. Outcome analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Trying to think about the business from the perspective of users' ultimate goals and needs (recognizing that your product or service may be only a means to an end).
  </p>
  <h3 id="technology-analysis">
   <a>
    1.3.2. Technology analysis
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Reviewing existing and emerging technologies and asking how they might be applied in your company (either as a process improvement or a product).
  </p>
  <h3 id="activity-elimination">
   <a>
    1.3.3. Activity elimination
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Systematically (but as a thought exercise) eliminating each step in a process, and asking what the implications are.

   Business processes underlie performance. One way to measure them: graph flow units vs. time, showing cumulative inflow and cumulative outflow. Then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    (Instantaneous) inventory is the vertical distance between c.inflow and c.outflow
   </li>
   <li>
    Flow time is the horizontal distance between c.inflow and c.outflow—the time a flow unit spends in the system
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Create a process flow diagram aka value stream map showing how flow units are transformed from inputs to outputs by process activities. Represent wait times, lines, or inventories with triangles, and activities with boxes (labeled with activity time in units, and m, the number of workers or resources). Then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Processing time is the sum of all the individual activity times
   </li>
   <li>
    Capacity is driven by processing time: m/processing time
   </li>
   <li>
    The bottleneck is the activity with lowest capacity, and this lowest capacity is the overall process capacity
   </li>
   <li>
    Flow rate aka throughput is min{demand_rate, process_capacity}, so flow rate is driven by these factors
   </li>
   <li>
    Utilization is flow_rate/capacity (dimensionless)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Realistically, processing times will vary from flow unit to flow unit. Flow units may even follow different pathways through all possible process activities. So, how to find the bottleneck and determine the flow rate? Depict multiple flow units on same process diagram, symbolized as types of flow units, then:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Approach #1, “adding up demand streams”: (1) Compute capacity of each process activity: m/activity_time (2) Compute demand experienced by each activity (3) Compute implied utilization as ratio of demand to capacity (can sum to more than 100%); now, the activity with highest implied utilization is the bottleneck
   </li>
   <li>
    Approach #2, “minutes of work”: (1) Based on m, how many minutes of work per hour can each activity supply? (2) Calculate how many minutes of work is required by each demand stream (3) Compute ratio of minutes required to minutes available; highest is the bottleneck
   </li>

   Why focus on this when labor seems to contribute less to modern firms’ costs? —because many firms keep labor costs off their balance sheet by ‘outsourcing’ them to their suppliers. If you account for labor in the cost of goods supplied, the role of labor becomes evident.

   <li>

    All activities except the bottleneck have idle time=cycle_time-process_time, and the sum of these is direct idle time

    Average labor utilization is labor_content / (labor_content+direct_idle_time)

   Motivating question here is why should there be inventory? What are the drivers of inventory? (Note that, per Little’s law, these same factors are implicit drivers of flow time.) Contrast McDonald’s and Subway—not all companies use inventory to increase flow rate; there are make-to-stock vs. make-to-order strategies.

  <ul>
   <li>
    The reason is variability of activity times; workers do not “work like robots”, so “buffer or suffer”.
   </li>
   <li>
    Reasons for inventory: buffer seasonal demand, internal demand (between processes or activities), customer demand, inherent time lag in production (e.g., aging cheese).

    Adding representations of quality to a flow diagram:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Dropped flow units: Calculate end demand; calculate yield of each step (include defects); calculate how much each step must produce to meet demand (e.g., a 50% defect rate means that an activity must produce 2xD); calculate implied utilization (D/capacity); highest implied utilization is the bottleneck.
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      Re-worked flow units: Calculate the expected processing time. E.g. if there is a 30% defect rate and defects are re-worked, then the real processing time is 0.7
      <em>
       processing_time + 0.3
      </em>
      rework_time. After this modification, the activity with lowest capacity is the bottleneck.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Costs of defects: Say that we pay $2 per flow unit as an input, but receive $20 per flow unit post-processing, as an output. Then the cost of defects depends not on where they occur, but where they are detected—before or after the bottleneck. Before is cheaper. Pre-bottleneck, defect costs are driven by input costs; post-bottleneck, by revenue (opportunity cost).
   </li>
   <li>
    Variability &amp; buffering dilemma:
    <ul>
     <li>
      For a 2-step process where each step has p(defect)=0.5, there are four possibilities: both defect-free; first step defective, leaving step 2 “starved”; second step defective, leaving step one “blocked”; and both defective. This variability dramatically lowers the expected flow rate; by adding a buffer, the flow rate may be increased.
     </li>
     <li>
      However, buffers remove the incentive for process improvement; buffering hides problems.
     </li>
     <li>
      Toyota developed the Kanban “demand-pull” card system to manage this dilemma. Kanban cards authorize work, and are themselves authorized by customer demand. This puts a cap on inventory.
