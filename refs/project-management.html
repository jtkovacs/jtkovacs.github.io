   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Bloch, Blumberg, and Laartz (n.d.), IT projects often suffer major delays and budget overruns. Best practices to avoid or limit these unwelcome outcomes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Focus on strategy and stakeholders, not exclusively budget and scheduling
   </li>
   <li>
    Ensure talent is sufficient to execute the project
   </li>
   <li>
    Align team incentives with project incentives and have adequate team infrastructure
   </li>
   <li>
    Have excellent project management, including short delivery cycles and quality checks
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   PESTEL, Porter's five, and SWOT/SLOT analyses are more common in the context of organizational strategic planning, but they can also be scoped to evaluate the desirability and feasibility of projects. Per Ross and Weill (2012), there are six strategic decisions that must be made at the outset of a project, but shouldn't be made by IT people:

  <p>
   The general aim of stakeholder analysis is to identify stakeholders; analyze their interests and expectations; categorize interests and expectations based on importance and level of stakeholder influence; and develop an action plan that delimits roles for different stakeholders. Stakeholder analysis is important for managing the scope, influence and interorganizational politics of a project, as well as ensuring that projects address all relevant needs (including social equity goals).

   Different authors present different stakeholder typologies. Per Leffingwell (2010):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Users
    </strong>
    are stakeholders
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     System stakeholders
    </strong>
    are those who:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Will use the system
     </li>
     <li>
      Will work with those who use the system
     </li>
     <li>
      Will be impacted by the deployment and operation of a system
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Project stakeholders

    are those who:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Have a vested interest in the project's budget and schedule

   Per Hill &amp; Cantera (2015):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Establish a simple definition for "business process" that everyone understands. Adopt Gartner's definition as a starting point.
    <ul>
     <li>
      Management process: highest level of abstraction; processes centered on mission statement and long-term vision
     </li>
     <li>
      Administrative process: maintaining a functioning organization
     </li>
     <li>
      Operational process: day-to-day operations
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Assess proposed changes to business processes in terms of the probability of the change directly impacting the desired business outcome. A "good" change is one that improves enterprise business outcomes (not just functional unit outcomes), or that must be made for compliance reasons. Our 2014 study of business transformation initiatives shows that one-third of organizations have an insufficient understanding of their business strategy, and 35% fail to translate the business strategy into measurable business goals.
   </li>
   <li>
    Work backwards from the business outcome using 5 whys, Fishbone diagram, or customer journey mapping.
   </li>
   <li>
    A Level 0 process diagram is a simple way of communicating how the organization works. It is the highest representation of the enterprise's business operations from a process perspective ... In our view, every organization would benefit from having such a visual to facilitate communications about improving the outcomes from business operations. Such a visual should fit on a single piece of paper.
   </li>
   <li>
    Identify key processes and pair them with metrics. (Metrics can be of the form 'from X to Y' but should be outside-in; e.g.,"from purchase request to receipt".)
    <ul>
     <li>
      How do we make our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do our customers receive/experience the value of our product or service?

     <li>
      How do we collect money for our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do we support (provide customer service for) our product or service?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do we source the raw materials or talent we need to create our product or service?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Look at the process as-is and try to simplify it, rather than leaping to IT automation as the solution. "Automation is very good for scaling work (with speed and capacity) without a commensurate increase in head count, for lowering the cost of performing the work (since, theoretically, machines can work 24/7) and for increasing the consistency of the output. If these are the kinds of improvements desired, then automation is an appropriate answer."

    2.3.2. Defining &amp; managing scope

  <p>
   Per Sheen (2015), scope creep is pervasive. Scope should be clearly addressed during the project initiation phase by (1) listing what's in and out of scope, provided stakeholders agree about scope; or (2) establishing scope ranges AKA scope tolerance parameters, which can be pinpointed as information emerges. A task is out of scope if it (1) doesn't make a direct contribution to the project goal, or (2) if time and money are binding constraints.
   <strong>
    Project the impact of requested additional tasks;
   </strong>
   never simply agree to perform them.

   In the traditional "serial" or lifecycle project management approach, requirements are translated into deliverables, deliverables are translated into a work breakdown structure (WBS), and the WBS is translated into a schedule and budget. Per Ambler (1999), about two-thirds of requirements elicited in this way lead to features that are never or rarely used, i.e. "spectacular levels of waste". In response, Agile tries to match development processes to the realities of constantly shifting requirements using:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    ... in place of a schedule, a
    <strong>
     stack

  <p>
   Per Wikipedia (2017), a work breakdown structure (WBS) is a
   <strong>
    hierarchical decomposition of a project's total work.
   </strong>
   WBS elements are coded as 1.0, 1.1, 1.10.11, etc. Child elements must sum to 100% of their parent element, and so on until 100% of the project's total work is accounted for. Elements must be mutually exclusive, which is easier to accomplish if elements are
   <em>
    outcomes,
   </em>
   not tasks. There are different heuristics for establishing the terminal granularity of a WBS:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    80 hour rule: smallest element must not exceed 80 hours of work
   </li>
   <li>
    Smallest element must be small enough to occur within the standard reporting period
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once the hierarchy is established, terminal elements are budgeted and scheduled.

    business requirements
   </strong>
   (from the perspective of stakeholders, including users), second as
   <strong>
    system requirements
   </strong>
   (from the perspective of developers). Requirements are also categorized as
   <strong>
    functional
   </strong>
   (what business tasks a system must perform) and
   <strong>
    nonfunctional
   </strong>
   (operational, performance, security, cultural and political requirements that affect how tasks are performed, and may arise from regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley or the desire to comply with standards such as

   </a>
   is important to differentiate functional from nonfunctional requirements because:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    They apply to different levels of the system (nonfunctional = system as a whole)
   </li>
   <li>
    They are of interest to different people (or some people may only be interested in a subset of requirements)
   </li>
   <li>
    They are of interest at different points in the system development lifecycle (nonfunctional = architecture)
   </li>
   <li>
    They may be modeled/represented in different ways (nonfunctional = quality attribute scenario)
   </li>
   <li>
    Differentiating conceptually helps you be more thorough when eliciting and analyzing requirements

  </p>
  <ul>

    Complete but feasible, necessary and prioritized
   </li>
   <li>
    Unambiguous and clear
   </li>

      </em>
     </li>
    </ul>

    The inevitably iterative nature of requirements is poorly managed

  <h4 id="current-state-analysis">

  </h4>
  <p>
   A current state analysis produces models of the
   <strong>
    as-is system
   </strong>
   (see
   <a href="modeling.html">
    notes on system &amp; process modeling techniques
   </a>
   that are used). Per Dennis et al. (2012), a requirements determination process
   <em>
    may
   </em>
   begin with current state analysis; this, however, depends on:
  </p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The methodology used by the systems development team:
     </strong>
     "Users of traditional design methods such as waterfall and parallel development (see Chapter 1) typically spend significant time understanding the as-is system and identifying improvements before moving to capture requirements for the to-be system. However, newer RAD, agile, and object-oriented methodologies, such as phased development, prototyping, throwaway prototyping, extreme programming, and Scrum (see Chapter 1) focus almost exclusively on improvements and the to-be system requirements."
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     The context of the system being developed:
    </strong>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
     <li>
      No current system exists
     </li>
     <li>

    <p>
     <strong>

     i.e. BPA vs. BPI vs. BPR (see
     <a href="process-improvement.html">
      notes on process improvement

   Per Whitney (n.d.), Dennis et al. (2012), and Ambler (1999), once gathered, requirements may be preserved, analyzed, and expressed in different ways:
  </p>
  <h4 id="actors">
   <a>
    4.1.4.1. Actors
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Actors are the generic users of a system, e.g. customers, that might appear on a system diagram. Note that actors include other software as well as people. Leffingwell (2010) proposes some questions for identifying actors:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Who uses the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who gets information from the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who provides information to the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Where is the system used?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who supports and maintains the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    What other systems or devices use this system?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Per Wirfs-Brock and McKean (2001),
   <strong>
    primary actors
   </strong>
   are outside the system designers' control, and issue requests to the system;
   <strong>
    secondary actors
   </strong>
   respond to requests
   <em>
    from
   </em>
   the system.
  </p>
  <h5 id="personas">
   <a>
    4.1.4.1.1. Personas
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Personas are different personalities that are meant to humanize a generic actor and show the range of users' needs. Personas are fictional but research-based biographies that reflect your understanding of your users; they are an exercise in fostering empathy and user-centered design. A
   <strong>
    primary persona
   </strong>
   is one whose needs are distinct enough to require a dedicated interface.
  </p>
  <h4 id="user-stories">
   <a>
    4.1.4.2. User stories
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Per Ambler (n.d.), user stories describe, at a high level, the various actions users need to complete. User stories should be written by business or subject matter experts, using the form
   <strong>
    "As an X, I need to Y so I can Z."
   </strong>
   User stories are refined (split, grouped, reprioritized, etc.) throughout the development process. User stories may be grouped by their
   <strong>
    themes.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <h4 id="use-cases">
   <a>
    4.1.4.3. Use cases
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   User stories can be decomposed into use cases, enumerating actors' interactions with the system as they pursue their goals. Leffingwell (2010) proposes some questions for identifying use cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    What will the actor use the system for?
   </li>
   <li>
    Will the actor create, store, change, remove, or read data in the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Will the actor need to inform the system about external events or changes?
   </li>
   <li>
    Will the actor need to be informed about certain occurrences in the system?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Similarly, from Schneider and Winters (1998):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Who uses the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who installs the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who starts up the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who maintains the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who shuts down the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    What other systems use this system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who gets information from this system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Who provides information to the system?
   </li>
   <li>
    Does anything happen automatically at a present time?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="use-case-levels">
   <a>
    4.1.4.3.1. Use case levels
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   Per Wirfs-Brock and McKean (2001), use cases are written at different levels that, combined, depict the whole system:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Summary, the highest level overview;
   </li>
   <li>
    Core, human task-level descriptions;
   </li>
   <li>
    Supporting, decomposing tasks;
   </li>
   <li>
    Internal, describing interactions between system components.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h5 id="use-scenarios">
   <a>
    4.1.4.3.2. Use scenarios
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   There may be different paths through a use cases, perhaps corresponding to different personas; these paths are called use scenarios, and they may be depicted with a
   <a href="modeling.html#activity-diagrams">
    UML activity diagram
   </a>
   or written as a series of bullet points (called a
   <strong>
    scenario form).
   </strong>
  </p>
  <h5 id="conversation-form">
   <a>
    4.1.4.3.3. Conversation form
   </a>
  </h5>
  <p>
   This is a two-column depiction of a use case/scenario, showing interactions between an actor and the system. User actions should be represented at the level of the user's
   <em>
    intentions,
   </em>
   i.e. their goals rather than the minute actions they may need to achieve their goals (although this depends greatly on the level of the system diagram).
  </p>
  <h5 id="use-case-diagrams">
   <a>
    4.1.4.3.4. Use case diagrams

  </h5>
  <p>
   Use cases may be depicted collectively with
   <a href="modeling.html#use-case-diagrams">
    use case diagrams
   </a>
   that:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>

   </li>
   <li>
    Connect use cases to each other:
    <ul>
     <li>
      &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; (routinely shared functionality)
     </li>
     <li>
      &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; (exceptional scenario)
