    1.1. Booth's elements of instructional literacy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Capacity for
    <strong>
     reflective practice
    </strong>
    (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
   </li>
   <li>
    Knowledge of
    <strong>
     educational theories,
    </strong>
    consisting of
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Learning theories,
      </strong>
      historically the province of psychology, more abstract and fundamental;
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Instructional theories,
      </strong>
      oriented towards teacher practice;
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Curriculum theories,
      </strong>
      focused on 'genre' in teaching;
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Mastery of
    <strong>
     teaching technologies
    </strong>
    (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
   </li>
   <li>
    Integration and application of the prior three items, i.e. skill in
    <strong>
     instructional design
    </strong>
    (Robert Gagné)
   </li>
  </ul>

    1.2.1. Education vs. training

  </h3>
  <p>
   Booth (2011, p. 51) notes that some people distinguish between education and training on the basis of transfer (which education aims to promote).

  <h3 id="academia-vs.-real-world-learning">
   <a>
    1.2.2. Academia vs. real-world learning
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Via Bransford et al. (2014), academic work is typically more solitary and cognitive than other contexts, although collaboration and use of tools may be increasingly present in some disciplines.

   Per Booth (2011):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    [logistics]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Focus on goals
     </li>
     <li>
      Be organized enough to achieve them
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    [interpersonal]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Be authentic

   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    get attention, hold interest:
    <strong>
     UNEXPECTED, STORIES,
    </strong>
    clearly relevant, clearly actionable
   </li>
   <li>
    facilitate comprehension:
    <strong>
     SIMPLE, CONCRETE
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    appeal and persuade:
    <strong>
     CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL
    </strong>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="a-miscellany-of-advice-and-insights">
   <a>
    2.3. A miscellany of advice and insights
   </a>
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching (Booth, 2011)
   </li>
   <li>
    Diversify the kinds of thinking you ask learners to do; try to activate as many parts of the brain as possible; don't try to favor people's preferred learning styles (Beneteau, 2017; also Brown et al., 2014)

   Per Booth (2011):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Memory
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Manage cognitive overload (manage environment, curate inputs so they are of better quality, which includes their structure)
     </li>
     <li>
      Mnemonics (structuring information logically AKA chunking; alphabetically; metaphorically; spatially)
     </li>
     <li>
      Elaboration (associating with existing information)
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Motivation
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Maslow and deprivation needs vs. growth needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Intrinsic (inherent/already internalized) versus extrinsic (incentivized/coerced) motivation
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Environment
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "practical factors such as room dimensions, furniture, and seating capacity; ... lighting and temperature;

     <li>
      "technical factors such as computing technology and presentation media;

     <li>
      "cultural elements such as language accessibility and inclusiveness; and

     <li>
      "instructional elements such as tone, pacing, classroom dynamics, discussion management, and opportunities for interaction" (Booth, 2011, p. 45)

     <li>
      Readiness for learning (Piaget)

  </ul>
  <p>
   Via Booth (2011, pp. 41-42), Robert Gagné, a founder of instructional design, believes learning is a function of the "interplay" between the following factors (note that not all of them are under the instructor's control):

    A "performance orientation" (citng Dweck, 1989) tends to sap motivation, versus a "learning orientation" (AKA growth mindset?)

  <h4 id="kellers-model">
   <a>
    3.1.3.1. Keller's model
   </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   Per Keller (1983), motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is
   <em>
    why
   </em>
   people learn, rather than
   <em>
    how.
   </em>
   Keller writes practically on motivation but grounds it in his prior theoretical work. This work, in keeping with field theory/social learning theory, starts from the assumption that B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person,
   <strong>
    B=f(E,P).
   </strong>
   Then, as categories of behavior, Keller distinguishes between:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Effort
    </strong>
    = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtk: I dispute this, because e.g. mental health];
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Performance
    </strong>
    = f(motivation/effort, ability, opportunity); and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Consequences
    </strong>
    = performance + (benefits to the individual = reinforce motivation)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Determinants E and P may be examined for each behavior, identifying instructional strategies:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img src="illos/motivation.png"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   A very important note:
   <strong>
    optimal motivation is moderate motivation
   </strong>
   (excess motivation is anxiety). This should be considered in motivational design, e.g. when setting the level of risk/reward (it should be moderate).

   Along with
   <strong>
    recall
   </strong>
   (retrieve and apply this knowledge if a similar situation arises), Booth (2011, p. 43) says a fundamental goal of instruction is transfer (retrieve and apply this in novel ways). Interestingly, per Bransford et al. (2014):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "Different kinds of learning experiences can look equivalent when test of learning focus solely on remembering ... but they can look quite different when tests of transfer are used" (p. 51).
   </li>
   <li>
    Classical education practices assumed transfer in their doctrine of "formal discipline", i.e. their belief that studying Latin trained the mind like a muscle for other tasks (probably not true of minds or muscles).
   </li>
   <li>
    Some researchers treat transfer as a matter of conceptual overlap, others as a matter of skill overlap.

    <strong>
     Near vs. far:

    "[T]hese terms distinguish the closeness or distance [or dis/similarity] between the original learning and the transfer task" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Positive vs. negative:
    </strong>
    "When learning in one context improves[/inhibits] learning or performance in another context" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Simple vs. complex:
    </strong>
    "Simple transfer happens when little or no effort is required to apply what has been learned in one situation to a new situation [and the opposite for complex transfer]" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic vs. mindful:
    </strong>
    " When an individual responds spontaneously within a transfer situation, which is very similar to the learning situation then this is automatic transfer … In contrast, mindful [or] high road transfer is deliberate and involves conscious thought and intellectual effort, and occurs in situations where there are significant gaps or differences between the original and the transfer situations" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Overzealous:
    </strong>
    " Of particular concern are situations where students transfer skills, knowledge, and routines that are effective for the task at hand but may nevertheless be suboptimal in the long run because they block additional learning. We will call this overzealous transfer (OZT) — people transfer solutions that appear to be positive because they are working well enough, but they are nevertheless negative with respect to learning what is new" (Schwartz et al., 2012).

      Let students engage with real problems and struggle a bit before lecturing (increases benefit of lecture)
     </li>
     <li>
      Learning takes time; allow for it

    and underlying logic, since "[k]nowledge that is overly contextualized [i.e., 'narrowly tailored to a given situation', NOT 'transparently placed in context'] can reduce transfer" (note that this is in keeping with cognitivist learning theories).

   Per Stevens and Tieman (2017), the origin of PBL was contemporanous with critical pedagogy (Freire, 2009; Shore, 1996; hooks, 1994) but elsewhere---in McMaster's medical schools, spreading to libraries c. 1990s. They identify the following open questions in PBL, at least in the context of library instruction:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How important is group work when it comes to problem-solving? Should groups report to the class?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While admitting that their own experiment with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (see Freire, 2009) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers".
