    1.1. Booth's elements of instructional literacy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Capacity for
    <strong>
     reflective practice
    </strong>
    (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
   </li>
   <li>
    Knowledge of
    <strong>
     educational theories,
    </strong>
    consisting of
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Learning theories,
      </strong>
      historically the province of psychology, more abstract and fundamental;
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Instructional theories,
      </strong>
      oriented towards teacher practice AKA
      <strong>
       pedagogy;
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Curriculum theories,
      </strong>
      focused on 'genre' in teaching;
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Mastery of
    <strong>
     teaching technologies
    </strong>
    (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
   </li>
   <li>
    Skill in
    <strong>
     instructional design,
    </strong>
    a structured process that creates instructional products
   </li>
  </ul>

   <a>
    1.2.1. Education vs. training
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Booth (2011, p. 51) notes that some people distinguish between education and training on the basis of transfer (which education aims to promote).
  </p>
  <h3 id="academia-vs.-real-world-learning">
   <a>
    1.2.2. Academia vs. real-world learning
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Via Bransford et al. (2014), academic work is typically more solitary and cognitive than other contexts, although collaboration and use of tools may be increasingly present in some disciplines.
  </p>
  <h3 id="learning-environments-vs.-instructional-systems">
   <a>
    1.2.3. Learning environments vs. instructional systems
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This distinction comes from Gagné:
   <em>
    "learning environments
   </em>
   are constructivist educational spaces that provide the framework for self-discovery, whereas
   <em>
    instructional systems
   </em>
   are behaviorist/cognitivist spaces that 'focus on telling ... learners what they need to know'" (Booth, 2011, p. 87).

  <p>
   Per Booth (2011):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    [logistics]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Focus on goals
     </li>
     <li>

     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    [interpersonal]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Be authentic
     </li>
     <li>
      Show your personal investment in the class and the students
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="instructional-messages">
   <a>
    2.2. Instructional messages
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    get attention, hold interest:
    <strong>
     UNEXPECTED, STORIES,
    </strong>
    clearly relevant, clearly actionable
   </li>
   <li>
    facilitate comprehension:
    <strong>
     SIMPLE, CONCRETE
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    appeal and persuade:
    <strong>
     CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL
    </strong>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="a-miscellany-of-advice-and-insights">
   <a>
    2.3. A miscellany of advice and insights
   </a>
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching (Booth, 2011)
   </li>
   <li>
    Diversify the kinds of thinking you ask learners to do; try to activate as many parts of the brain as possible; don't try to favor people's preferred learning styles (Beneteau, 2017; also Brown et al., 2014)

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Memory
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Manage cognitive overload (manage environment, curate inputs so they are of better quality, which includes their structure)
     </li>
     <li>
      Mnemonics (structuring information logically AKA chunking; alphabetically; metaphorically; spatially)
     </li>
     <li>
      Elaboration (associating with existing information)
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Motivation
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Maslow and deprivation needs vs. growth needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Intrinsic (inherent/already internalized) versus extrinsic (incentivized/coerced) motivation
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Environment
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "practical factors such as room dimensions, furniture, and seating capacity; ... lighting and temperature;

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Prior knowledge
    </strong>
    i.e. schemata AKA mental models
    <ul>
     <li>
      Readiness for learning (Piaget)
     </li>
     <li>
      Respecting prior knowledge
     </li>
     <li>
      Activating prior knowledge

    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Via Booth (2011, pp. 41-42), Robert Gagné, a founder of instructional design, believes learning is a function of the "interplay" between the following factors (note that not all of them are under the instructor's control):

    3.1.3. Motivation
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is
   <em>
    why
   </em>
   people learn, rather than
   <em>
    how.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the Keller model below, Bransford et al. (2014) credit the following factors with increasing motivation:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A "performance orientation" (citng Dweck, 1989) tends to sap motivation, versus a "learning orientation" (AKA growth mindset?)
   </li>
   <li>
    Social recognition, shared work, solidarity
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Keller (1983) writes practically on motivation but grounds it in his prior theoretical work. This work, in keeping with field theory/social learning theory, starts from the assumption that B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person,
   <strong>
    B=f(E,P).
   </strong>
   Then, as categories of behavior, Keller distinguishes between:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Effort
    </strong>
    = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtk: I dispute this, because e.g. mental health];
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Performance
    </strong>
    = f(motivation/effort, ability, opportunity); and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Consequences
    </strong>
    = performance + (benefits to the individual = reinforce motivation)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Determinants E and P may be examined for each behavior, identifying instructional strategies:
  </p>
  <div class="figure">
   <img src="illos/motivation.png"/>
  </div>
  <p>
   A very important note:
   <strong>
    optimal motivation is moderate motivation
   </strong>
   (excess motivation is anxiety). This should be considered in motivational design, e.g. when setting the level of risk/reward (it should be moderate).

  <p>
   Along with
   <strong>
    recall
   </strong>
   (retrieve and apply this knowledge if a similar situation arises), Booth (2011, p. 43) says a fundamental goal of instruction is transfer (retrieve and apply this in novel ways). Interestingly, per Bransford et al. (2014):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "Different kinds of learning experiences can look equivalent when test of learning focus solely on remembering ... but they can look quite different when tests of transfer are used" (p. 51).
   </li>
   <li>
    Classical education practices assumed transfer in their doctrine of "formal discipline", i.e. their belief that studying Latin trained the mind like a muscle for other tasks (probably not true of minds or muscles).
   </li>
   <li>
    Some researchers treat transfer as a matter of conceptual overlap, others as a matter of skill overlap.

  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Near vs. far:
    </strong>
    "[T]hese terms distinguish the closeness or distance [or dis/similarity] between the original learning and the transfer task" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Positive vs. negative:
    </strong>
    "When learning in one context improves[/inhibits] learning or performance in another context" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Simple vs. complex:
    </strong>
    "Simple transfer happens when little or no effort is required to apply what has been learned in one situation to a new situation [and the opposite for complex transfer]" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic vs. mindful:
    </strong>
    " When an individual responds spontaneously within a transfer situation, which is very similar to the learning situation then this is automatic transfer … In contrast, mindful [or] high road transfer is deliberate and involves conscious thought and intellectual effort, and occurs in situations where there are significant gaps or differences between the original and the transfer situations" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Overzealous:
    </strong>
    " Of particular concern are situations where students transfer skills, knowledge, and routines that are effective for the task at hand but may nevertheless be suboptimal in the long run because they block additional learning. We will call this overzealous transfer (OZT) — people transfer solutions that appear to be positive because they are working well enough, but they are nevertheless negative with respect to learning what is new" (Schwartz et al., 2012).

    Provide transfer-supportive

     learning experiences:
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Something must be learned with sufficient depth before it can be transferred
     </li>
     <li>
      Understanding promotes transfer; mere memorization does not
     </li>
     <li>
      Let students engage with real problems and struggle a bit before lecturing (increases benefit of lecture)
     </li>
     <li>
      Learning takes time; allow for it
     </li>
     <li>
      Give feedback on transfer---how students are applying concepts in varying contexts

    and underlying logic, since "[k]nowledge that is overly contextualized [i.e., 'narrowly tailored to a given situation', NOT 'transparently placed in context'] can reduce transfer" (note that this is in keeping with cognitivist learning theories).
    <ul>
     <li>
      Make strong contrasts to facilitate pattern recognition

    How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While admitting that their own experiment with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (see Freire, 2009) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers".

  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), an educator can use the following process and skills to find their bearing in a constantly evolving technology landscape:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Experience
    </strong>
    the technologies in a personal authentic way (see pp. 66-68 for Booth's summary of Web 2.0 and emerging technologies as relevant to education);
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Evaluate
    </strong>
    them with respect to educational objectives; and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Customize
    </strong>
    tools for the given learning scenario
   </li>
  </ul>

   Booth identifies these ten affordances AKA functionality AKA features (quoted; 2011, p. 65):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     assessment:
    </em>
    template/customizable evaluation and analysis
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     collaboration:
    </em>
    shared effort, cooperation, and/or crowd-sourcing
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     communication:
    </em>
    contant and exchange among participants
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     customization:
    </em>
    personalizable features or appearance
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     documentation:
    </em>
    information recording for future use and access
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     play:
    </em>
    diversion and/or creative expression
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     portability:
    </em>
    mobile communication, creation, and access
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     productivity:
    </em>
    task-oriented learning and time management
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     sharing:
    </em>
    dissemination of ideas or information for public consumption
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     visualization:

   Instructional design combines

    educational theory
   </a>
   with
   <a href="./strategy.html#design-thinking">
    design thinking methods
   </a>
   to create a variety of instructional products. Per Booth (2011, p. 106), "ID is a systematic instructional planning approach that channels ... insight and awareness [from reflective practice, educational theory, and teaching technologies] into efficient, learner-focused pedagogy". Booth notes that ID is communicated in the form of models/frameworks and guiding principles.

   Molenda (2003) explains that ADDIE is an authorless abstraction that might form the foundation or core of other more specific instructional design methodologies. Per Piskurich (2000) and Booth (2011):

  <ul>

    These pre-ID activities should be performed, then presented in a report. For large projects, this phase might consume the majority of time:

     <li>
      needs assessment

     <li>
      performance assessment
