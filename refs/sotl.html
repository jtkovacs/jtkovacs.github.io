    1.1. Booth's elements of instructional literacy
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Capacity for
    <strong>
     reflective practice
    </strong>
    (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
   </li>
   <li>
    Knowledge of
    <strong>
     educational theories,
    </strong>
    consisting of
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Learning theories
      </strong>
      "explain how and why learning occurs";
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Instructional theories
      </strong>
      "address the methodology of teaching and pedagogy";
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Curriculum theories
      </strong>
      "focus on the content or subjects of instruction";
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Mastery of
    <strong>
     teaching technologies
    </strong>
    (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
   </li>
   <li>
    Integration and application of the prior three items, i.e. skill in
    <strong>
     instructional design

   From lectures by Philip J. Reed at the University of Washington iSchool, following Booth (2011) and Keller (1983):

    Scientific:

     <li>
      Psychology:
      <em>
       Reed notes that these approaches are both comfortable assessing learning through behavior change, not so for constructivism.
      </em>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Behaviorism
        </strong>
        (B. F. Skinner, rote memorization, reinforcement, feedback); dominant c. 1950s as an educational theory but still has currency in psychology, still embedded in common teaching and learning practices
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cognitivism
        </strong>
        (Jean Piaget, David Ausubel) focuses on learners' information processing AKA "assimilation of information into mental models" (Reed, 2017; AKA schemata, Booth, 2011, p. 44); "how to organize instruction" for "acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills", "also studied in relation to individual differences in ability and learning style" (Keller, 1983); note that this includes a much more active role for the student, believing that "knowledge is something that depends on your perception and how you put things together" (Reed, 2017)

       <li>
        <strong>
         Constructivism
        </strong>
        (John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky) focuses on how learners "construct their own learning process" (Reed, 2017) through "observation, translation, and imitation (mimesis, socialization, and modeling)" (Booth, 2011, p. 62), subject to social influences; mainstream view in education, but doesn't really speak to the issue of assessment

  <p>
   Per Mezirow (2009), transformative learning is a subset of "learning that transforms problematic [NB: different interpretations of this] frames of reference to make them more inclusive, discriminating, reflective, open, and emotionally able to change". Mezirow has defended the importance of rationality in transformative learning practices, contra other theorists in the field.

   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Per Stevens and Tieman (2017), the origin of PBL was contemporanous with critical pedagogy (Freire, 2009; Shore, 1996; hooks, 1994) but elsewhere---in McMaster's medical schools, spreading to libraries c. 1990s. They identify the following open questions in PBL, at least in the context of library instruction:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How important is group work when it comes to problem-solving? Should groups report to the class?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While admitting that their own experiment with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (see Freire, 2009) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers".

    motivation

     Effort

    = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtk: I dispute this, because e.g. mental health];

   A very important note:

  <p>
   Relevance = f(alignment, clear_connections). Drawing from
   <em>
    drive theory,
   </em>
   e.g. Maslow, Keller proposes a typology of personal (relevant to self) vs. instrumental (relevant to goals) vs. cultural (relevant to group)
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>

    <ul>
     <li>
      Promote a sense of

     </li>
     <li>
      Promote
      <strong>
       empowerment
      </strong>
      by allowing choice, responsibility, and influence
     </li>
     <li>
      Promote
      <strong>
       affiliation

      by establishing trust, which may include non-zero sum grading
     </li>
    </ul>

   <li>
    <strong>
     Instrumental
    </strong>
    relevance can be made clear through learning objectives
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Cultural
    </strong>
    relevance is a matter of inclusive content, approaches, and environments, but also raises the question of whether a learner's culture places a high value on the type of education being offered

   Satisfaction = f(intrinsic_reinforcement, extrinsic_reinforcement)

  <ul>
   <li>
    To preserve intrinsic motivation (which can be destroyed by extrinsic reinforcement):
    <ul>
     <li>
      give "endogeneous" rewards that "customarily or naturally follows from a task"
     </li>
     <li>
      give exogeneous rewards unexpectedly
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Give motivational feedback verbally and immediately
   </li>
   <li>
    Time informative/formative feedback (rather than evaluative/summative feedback) such that it is quickly actionable

  </h2>
  <p>
   Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    get attention, hold interest:
    <strong>
     UNEXPECTED, STORIES,
    </strong>
    clearly relevant, clearly actionable
   </li>
   <li>
    facilitate comprehension:
    <strong>
     SIMPLE, CONCRETE
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    appeal and persuade:
    <strong>
     CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL
    </strong>

  <h2 id="targets">

  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), targets “allow you to structure measurable learning interactions” and “improve the impact of instruction, particularly when participants have had a hand in defining them”. Targets form a hierarchy:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    OUTCOMES = hoped-for lasting changes
   </li>
   <li>
    GOALS = express a theory of how to produce outcomes
   </li>
   <li>
    OBJECTIVES = strategies/skills needed to attain goals
   </li>
  </ul>
