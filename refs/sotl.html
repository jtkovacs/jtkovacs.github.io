     Education vs. training:
    </strong>
    Booth (2014, p. 51) notes that some people distinguish between education and training on the basis of transfer (which education aims to promote, but training does not).

   <li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Academia vs. real-world learning:
      </strong>
      Via Bransford et al. (2014), academic work is typically more solitary and cognitive than other contexts, although collaboration and use of tools may be increasingly present in some disciplines.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Learning environments vs. instructional systems:
    </strong>
    This distinction comes from Gagné:
    <em>
     "learning environments
    </em>
    are constructivist educational spaces that provide the framework for self-discovery, whereas
    <em>
     instructional systems
    </em>
    are behaviorist/cognitivist spaces that 'focus on telling ... learners what they need to know'" (Booth, 2011, p. 87).

   Booth also presents her

  <p>
   Motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is
   <em>
    why
   </em>
   people learn, rather than
   <em>
    how.
   </em>
   It's important to know that
   <strong>
    optimal motivation is moderate motivation,
   </strong>
   and excess motivation is anxiety; this should be considered in motivational design, e.g. when setting the level of risk/reward (it should be moderate).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the Keller model below, Bransford et al. (2014) credit the following factors with increasing motivation:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    A learning orientation and growth mindset (see Dweck et al., 2014) versus a performance orientation
   </li>
   <li>
    Social recognition, shared work, and solidarity
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Keller (1983) writes practically on motivation but grounds it in his prior theoretical work. This work, in keeping with field theory/social learning theory, starts from the assumption that B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person,
   <strong>
    B=f(E,P).
   </strong>
   Then, as categories of behavior, Keller distinguishes between:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Effort
    </strong>
    = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtck: consider mental health though..];
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Performance
    </strong>
    = f(motivation/effort, ability, opportunity); and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Consequences
    </strong>
    = performance + (benefits to the individual = reinforce motivation)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Determinants E and P may be examined for each behavior, identifying instructional strategies:

  <p>
   Along with
   <strong>
    recall
   </strong>
   (retrieve and apply this knowledge if a similar situation arises), Booth (2014, p. 43) says a fundamental goal of instruction is transfer (retrieve and apply this in novel ways). Interestingly, per Bransford et al. (2014):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    "Different kinds of learning experiences can look equivalent when test of learning focus solely on remembering ... but they can look quite different when tests of transfer are used" (p. 51).
   </li>
   <li>
    Classical education practices assumed transfer in their doctrine of "formal discipline", i.e. their belief that studying Latin trained the mind like a muscle for other tasks (probably not true of minds or muscles).
   </li>
   <li>
    Some researchers treat transfer as a matter of conceptual overlap, others as a matter of skill overlap.

    <strong>
     Near vs. far:

    "[T]hese terms distinguish the closeness or distance [or dis/similarity] between the original learning and the transfer task" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Positive vs. negative:
    </strong>
    "When learning in one context improves[/inhibits] learning or performance in another context" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Simple vs. complex:
    </strong>
    "Simple transfer happens when little or no effort is required to apply what has been learned in one situation to a new situation [and the opposite for complex transfer]" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Automatic vs. mindful:
    </strong>
    " When an individual responds spontaneously within a transfer situation, which is very similar to the learning situation then this is automatic transfer … In contrast, mindful [or] high road transfer is deliberate and involves conscious thought and intellectual effort, and occurs in situations where there are significant gaps or differences between the original and the transfer situations" (Leberman, 2006).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Overzealous:
    </strong>
    " Of particular concern are situations where students transfer skills, knowledge, and routines that are effective for the task at hand but may nevertheless be suboptimal in the long run because they block additional learning. We will call this overzealous transfer (OZT) — people transfer solutions that appear to be positive because they are working well enough, but they are nevertheless negative with respect to learning what is new" (Schwartz et al., 2012).

  </h4>
  <p>
   Gardner &amp; Hatch (1989) argue for a richer understanding of intelligence as "the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or more cultural settings". They distinguish seven "intelligences" (another,
   <strong>
    naturalist,
   </strong>
   has been proposed):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Visual/spatial:
    </strong>
    "Capacities to perceive the visual-spatial world accurately and to perform transformations on one's initial perceptions."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Verbal/linguistic:
    </strong>
    "Sensitivity to the sounds, rhythms, and meanings of words; sensitivity to the different functions of language."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Logical/mathematical:
    </strong>
    "Sensitivity to, and capacity to discern, logical or numerical patterns; ability to handle long chains of reasoning."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Bodily/kinesthetic:
    </strong>
    "Abilities to control one's body movements and to handle objects skillfully."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Musical/rhythmic:
    </strong>
    "Abilities to produce and appreciate rhythm, pitch, and timbre; appreciation of the forms of musical expressiveness."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Interpersonal/social:
    </strong>
    "Capacities to discern and respond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, motivations, and desires of other people."
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Intrapersonal/introspective:
    </strong>
    "Access to one's own feelings and the ability to discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behavior; knowledge of one's own strengths, weaknesses, desires, and intelligence."
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While Brown et al. (2014) cite research challenging one of the main pedagogical implications of Gardner's theory --- viz., that instruction should be tailored to each learner's preferred modes (actually it should be varied for all learners) --- Eisner (2004) demonstrates the continuing (even accelerating) relevance of Gardner's work by using it to critique the educational standards movement, which in Eisner's opinion "symptomatizes a loss of faith in the professional competence of teachers" (p. 34). So this is the primary message to take from Gardner: people are gifted in different ways and that's fine (notice, however, that this leads to questions about educational in/equality and in/equity). Eisner also uses Gardner to criticize the institutionalized assumption that individual students will learn at constant rates, and a group of students will learn at a consistent pace such that they can progress as a cohort.

   Per Mezirow (2009), transformative learning is a subset of "learning that transforms problematic [NB: different interpretations of this] frames of reference to make them more inclusive, discriminating, reflective, open, and emotionally able to change". Mezirow has defended the importance of rationality in transformative learning practices, contra other theorists in the field.

   Per Stevens and Tieman (2017), the origin of PBL was contemporanous with critical pedagogy (Freire, 2009; Shore, 1996; hooks, 1994) but elsewhere---in McMaster's medical schools, spreading to libraries c. 1990s. They identify the following open questions in PBL, at least in the context of library instruction:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How important is group work when it comes to problem-solving? Should groups report to the class?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While admitting that their own experiment with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (see Freire, 2009) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers".

   Booth summarizes Mayer again (2014, p. 130):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Coherence:
    </strong>
    Extraneous words, sounds, and pictures are minimized. Modality : Narration occurs as speech rather than printed text in multimedia presentations.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Personalization:
    </strong>
    Narration occurs in conversational rather than formal style.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Pretraining:
    </strong>
    The learner knows the names and characteristics of the key concepts. Redundancy : Animation and narration are preferable in multimedia presentations over animation, narration, and on-screen text (to reduce cognitive overload).
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Segmenting:
    </strong>
    A fast-paced, complex multimedia lesson is presented in user-paced segments rather than as a continuous presentation.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Signaling:
    </strong>
    The essential material is highlighted. Spatial contiguity : Corresponding words and pictures are presented in proximity to one another on a page or screen.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Temporal contiguity:
    </strong>
    Corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively in time.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Voice:
    </strong>
    Narration occurs in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice."
   </li>
  </ul>

    3.3.4. Evaluating learning objects
   </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Booth presents a modified version of Lohr's schema for evaluating learning objects (2014, p. 130):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     "Effectiveness
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Does the learning object cover the correct content?
     </li>
     <li>
      Does the learning object cover an optimal amount of information (not too much and not too little content)?
     </li>
     <li>
      Does the learning object “work” instructionally?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Efficiency
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Does the learning object make important information (selection) easy to perceive?
     </li>
     <li>
      Is the learning object organized (organization) so that information is easy to access?
     </li>
     <li>
      Does the learning object help the user relate the information to the overall instructional or performance target (integration)?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Appeal
    </strong>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Does the design of learning object motivate the user to engage with it?
     </li>
     <li>
      Is the information in the learning object relevant and important to the user in the instructional context?
     </li>
     <li>
      Is the learning object clear enough to convince users that they will understand it?"
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>

  </h1>
  <p>
   Booth presents her
   <a href="#user-method">
    USER method
   </a>
   primarily as an instructional design model, but secondarily as an "instructional literacy framework that encourages you to reflect on your process in order to become a 'student of learning” as you teach' (2014, p. 95).

    4.1. Qualities of excellent teachers
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Booth (2014):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    [logistics]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Focus on goals
     </li>
     <li>
      Be organized enough to achieve them
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    [interpersonal]
    <ul>
     <li>
      Be authentic
     </li>
     <li>
      Show your personal investment in the class and the students
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="a-miscellany-of-advice-and-insights">
   <a>
    4.2. A miscellany of advice and insights
   </a>
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching (Booth, 2014)
   </li>
   <li>
    Diversify the kinds of thinking you ask learners to do; try to activate as many parts of the brain as possible; don't try to favor people's preferred learning styles (Beneteau, 2017; also Brown et al., 2014)
   </li>

  <p>
   Per Booth (2014), an educator can use the following process and skills to find their bearing in a constantly evolving technology landscape:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Experience
    </strong>
    the technologies in a personal authentic way (see pp. 66-68 for Booth's summary of Web 2.0 and emerging technologies as relevant to education);
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Evaluate
    </strong>
    them with respect to educational objectives; and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Customize
    </strong>
    tools for the given learning scenario
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="evaluating-teaching-technologies">

   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Booth identifies these ten affordances AKA functionality AKA features (quoted; 2014, p. 65):
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     assessment:
    </em>
    template/customizable evaluation and analysis
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     collaboration:
    </em>
    shared effort, cooperation, and/or crowd-sourcing
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     communication:
    </em>
    contant and exchange among participants
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     customization:
    </em>
    personalizable features or appearance
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     documentation:
    </em>
    information recording for future use and access
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     play:
    </em>
    diversion and/or creative expression
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     portability:
    </em>
    mobile communication, creation, and access
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     productivity:
    </em>
    task-oriented learning and time management
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     sharing:
    </em>
    dissemination of ideas or information for public consumption
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     visualization:
    </em>
    graphical information display
