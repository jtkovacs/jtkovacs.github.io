  <p>
   Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Capacity for
    <strong>
     reflective practice
    </strong>
    (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
   </li>
   <li>
    Knowledge of
    <strong>
     educational theory,
    </strong>
    consisting of
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Learning theory
      </strong>
      (how people learn)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Instructional theory

      </strong>
      (content- and audience-specific considerations);

    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Mastery of
    <strong>
     teaching technologies
    </strong>
    (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and

   <li>
    Integration and application of the prior three items, i.e. skill in

  </h2>
  <p>
   Keller (1983) writes practically on
   <a href="#motivation-design">
    motivation
   </a>
   but he grounds it in his prior theoretical work. This work, in keeping with field theory/social learning theory, starts from the assumption that B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person,
   <strong>
    B=f(E,P).
   </strong>
   Then, as categories of behavior, Keller distinguishes between
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Effort
    </strong>
    = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtk: I dispute this, because e.g. mental health];
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Performance
    </strong>
    = f(motivation/effort, ability, opportunity); and
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Consequences
    </strong>
    = performance + (benefits to the individual = reinforce motivation)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Determinants E and P may be examined for each behavior, identifying instructional strategies:

    2.3. Problem-based learning
   </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
   Per Stevens and Tieman (2017), the origin of PBL was contemporanous with critical pedagogy (Freire, Shore, books) but elsewhere---in McMaster's medical schools, spreading to libraries c. 1990s. They identify the following open questions in PBL, at least in the context of library instruction:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    How important is group work when it comes to problem-solving? Should groups report to the class?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   While admitting that their own experience with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide to small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (Freire) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers").

  <p>
   Per Keller (1983), motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is
   <em>
    why
   </em>
   people learn, rather than
   <em>
    how.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   A very important note:
   <strong>
    optimal motivation is moderate motivation
   </strong>
   (excess motivation is anxiety). This should be considered in motivational design, e.g. when setting the level of risk/reward (it should be moderate).
  </p>
  <p>
   Keller's
   <a href="#kellers-model-of-motivation-learning-and-reinforcement">
    theory of learning
   </a>
   and the underlying sciences imply that motivational design should address:

   Interest = f(trait_curiosity,presentation); see

      Trait vs.
      <em>

      </em>
     </li>
     <li>
      Note that curiosity can be fatigued by excessive stimulation
     </li>
     <li>
      Appeal to emotions, personal experience, the familiar e.g. with analogies, metaphors, anecdotes, questions
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     <em>
      Sustain curiosity:

     <li>
      Allowance to explore

   Relevance = f(alignment, clear_connections). Drawing from

   e.g. Maslow, Keller proposes a typology of personal (relevant to self) vs. instrumental (relevant to goals) vs. cultural (relevant to group)

     <li>
      Promote
      <strong>
       empowerment
      </strong>

     </li>
     <li>
      Promote
      <strong>
       affiliation

      by establishing trust, which may include non-zero sum grading
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Instrumental
    </strong>
    relevance can be made clear through learning objectives
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Cultural
    </strong>
    relevance is a matter of inclusive content, approaches, and environments, but also raises the question of whether a learner's culture places a high value on the type of education being offered

    OUTCOMES = hoped-for lasting changes
