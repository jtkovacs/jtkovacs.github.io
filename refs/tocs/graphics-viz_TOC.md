# 1. Graphic design principles

(Note that many of the sources below are from the domain of instructional design and pertain to the visual and/or informational design of learning objects.)

## 1.1. Mayer's strategies

Per Booth (2014, p. 127): "Richard Mayer lists seven such strategies that make more efficient use of cognitive processing capacity in instructional interfaces, materials, and graphics:

- **Concentrated:** Core ideas are emphasized via highlighting, bolding, and other strategies.
- **Concise:** Brevity and simplicity are achieved by eliminating extraneous text and images.
- **Correspondent:** Pictures, charts, and tables and their captions are placed close to one another.
- **Concrete:** Images provide clear visualizations of the subjects in question.
- **Coherent:** Picture choices are logical and correspond with narration, captions, or surrounding text.
- **Comprehensible:** Graphics and text or narration reflect the prior knowledge of the viewer.
- **Codable:** Graphics and text or narration lend themselves to being integrated into memory."

## 1.2. Lohr's PAT model

Booth (2011) summarizes Linda Lohr's approach to visual design for instructional purposes:

**Principles** are the broad "cognitive functions" that comprise someone's interaction with a visual instructional object:

- **Selection** (filtering what's important): guided by the Gestalt **figure/ground** principle (people can't pay attention to everything, so know what you want to emphasize and then make the emphasis obvious)
- **Organization** (parsing the 'figure;): supported by "clear and consistent navigational elements, chunking information into content units that reflect instructional objectives, providing scaffolding in the form of assistance and support, and incorporating hierarchical elements such as lists, charts, and outlines that suggest relationships"
- **Integration** (situating the figure)

**Actions:**

- **Contrast** to emphasize dissimilarity and create interest
- **Proximity** to convey relatedness
- **Repetition** to reduce cognitive burden and emphasize structure (pathways)
- **Alignment** to maximize readability and reduce visual noise

Adjust mood, readability, accessibility, etc. with **tools:**

- Font & typeface
- Color
- Shapes
- Depth/details/realism
- Whitespace

## 1.3. Gestalt principles

Per Reynolds (2009):

- Figure/ground
- Continuation
- Closure
- Implied space (cropping)
- Implied depth (scale)




# 2. Designing specific objects

## 2.1. Presentation slides

Culled from Duarte ('D', 2008) and Reynolds ('R', 2009):

- **Slides should complement the narrative,** not duplicate it ("dual channels")
- One point per slide (R)
- Aim for high signal-to-noise ratio (R)
- Favor images over text; more engaging, more memorable; "picture superiority effect" (R)
    - Relevant
    - Not clich√©
    - ... but QUOTES are also great for sparking interest and enhancing credibility
- Pay attn to size, placement, resolution, aspect
    - Use full-slide ("full bleed") images (R)
    - Try for "asymmetric balance" rather than symmetry (R)
    - 330 ppi resolution for high-quality print images; 100 ppi for screen (R)
    - Use enough white space
- Make sure text is readable
    - Place text on semi-transparent solid background when it overlaps an image (R)
- Try embedded videos

### 2.1.1. Image filetypes

Per Reynolds (2009):

- **JPEG** is good for photos on the web, but lossy when compressed
- **GIF** is good for drawings (only 256 colors)
- **PNG** lets you adjust transparency
- **EPS** is for vectors
- **TIFF** is high res, good for print

#### 2.1.1.1. Photography tips

- For people:
    - Avoid direct sunlight (generally creates unflattering shadows)
    - Focus on eyes
    - Place head in upper third of frame, slightly off-center
- Tripod stablizes and creates better photos in low-light conditions
- Use the White Balance feature in response to light conditions
- Explore different vantage points


## 2.2. Multimedia learning objects

Booth summarizes Mayer again (2014, p. 130):

- **"Coherence:** Extraneous words, sounds, and pictures are minimized.
- **Modality:** Narration occurs as speech rather than printed text in multimedia presentations.
- **Personalization:** Narration occurs in conversational rather than formal style.
- **Pretraining:** The learner knows the names and characteristics of the key concepts.
- **Redundancy:** Animation and narration are preferable in multimedia presentations over animation, narration, and on-screen text (to reduce cognitive overload).
- **Segmenting:** A fast-paced, complex multimedia lesson is presented in user-paced segments rather than as a continuous presentation.
- **Signaling:** The essential material is highlighted. Spatial contiguity : Corresponding words and pictures are presented in proximity to one another on a page or screen.
- **Temporal contiguity:** Corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively in time.
- **Voice:** Narration occurs in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice."
