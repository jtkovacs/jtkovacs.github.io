# 1. What is management?

## 1.1. Managerial hierarchy

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| CEO | Coordinate C-Suite; interacts with Board and shareholders |
| Top management AKA C-Suite | Cross-departmental decision-making |
| Middle management | Make departmental decisions; develop expertise in functional area |
| First-line management AKA front-line management AKA supervisors | Supervise employees, manage projects and products |

## 1.2. Managerial skills

According to Jones and George (2015), management involves the following tasks, with upper-level managers more involved in _planning and organizing_ while lower-level managers are more involved with _leading and controlling:_

- **Planning** AKA [strategy](#strategy)
    - Setting goals
    - Choosing strategies
    - Allocating **resources,** [see notes on finance & accounting](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/fin-acctg.html)
        - People and skills
        - Machinery and materials
        - Computers and IT
        - Patents, capital, and goodwill
- **Organizing**
    - Defining [organizational architecture](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/org-arch.html)
    - Defining lines of reporting and other communication channels (related to [knowledge management\)](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/km.html)
- [Leading](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/leadership.html) with "power, personality, influence, persuasion, and communication skills" that rally people around a vision
- **Controlling** (monitoring and correcting) execution of strategies
    - [Performance management & process improvement](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/performance-management.html)
    - [Project management](https://jtkovacs.github.io/refs/project-management.html)

Another typology comes from Mintzenberg (cited in Jones and George, 2015), who identifies 10 roles that managers play:

- DECISIONAL
    - entrepreneur [opportunity-finder]
    - disturbance handler
    - resource allocator
    - negotiator
- INTERPERSONAL
    - figurehead
    - leader
    - liaison
- INFORMATIONAL
    - monitor
    - disseminator
    - spokesperson

From Jones & George (2015):

- restructuring, downsizing, outsourcing, insourcing

- challenging to maintain competitive advantage
- pressure to be ethically and socially responsible

### 1.5.3. Strategic thinking

#### 1.5.3.1. Analytic thinking

(vs synthetic, dialectic)

#### 1.5.3.2. Design thinking

See [notes on design thinking](design.html#design-thinking)

#### 1.5.3.3. Systems thinking

Per Vassallo (2017):

Systems thinking operates on systems; systems are parts that are interconnected, leading to **emergent** behavior. This means a system must be studied as a whole; it is dangerous to study parts in isolation. And when the system is analyzed as a whole, it may reveal **leverage points** where interventions (which may be small) can trigger large or simply _persistent_ changes in system states (i.e., design). Despite Vassallo's phrasing, this is _not_ the same idea as incremental change or iteration, nor is it the same as the idea that a small change can have a large cumulative impact given a large user population.

"The vocabulary of formal systems thinking is one of **causal loops, unintended consequences, emergence, and system dynamics.** Practicing systems theorists employ tools such as **systemigrams, archetypes, stock and flow diagrams, interpretive structural modeling, and systemic root cause analysis ... the Iceberg Model and ... leverage points.**

##### 1.5.3.3.1. Iceberg model

Per Vassallo (2017): **Values** (our aspirations and vision) inform our **mental models,** which "give birth to" **systemic structures** ("how the components of the system are organized") that are visible as **patterns** of **events;** any one of these levels can be points of intervention.
