# 1. What's the scientific method?

... the quest to produce useful, high-quality knowledge.

## 1.1. Institutions of scientific knowledge production

What are major institutions of knowledge production, and how well are they working?

### 1.1.1. Academic apprenticeship

#### 1.1.1.1. How does disciplinary training impact knowledge?

### 1.1.2. Peer review & replicability

### 1.1.3. Libraries & the accumulation of knowledge

## 1.2. Academic vs. practitioner knowledge

## 1.3. Expert vs. crowdsourced knowledge



# 2. The research process

## 2.1. Generating questions

## 2.2. Operationalizing concepts

## 2.3. Reviewing literature

### 2.3.1. Strategies for finding articles

### 2.3.2. Strategies for reading well

Adler, M. J. (). _How to read a book._

### 2.3.3. What is a literature review?

The important thing to understand is that a literature review proper is a research method; it is not peripheral to research.

### 2.3.4. What types of literature reviews exist?

## 2.4. Sampling

## 2.5. Choosing a research method

What are major study designs and purposes? E.g. experiment, difference-in-differences, etc. What exists; how things are connected; what might happen.

Qualitative methods are premised on the ontological position that the world is multifaceted; the epistemological position that one explores a multifaceted world through people's subjectivities; and the political position that including a wider range of subjectivities in knowledge production leads to more just, effective decision-making. See GEOG 425 - Final paper.
