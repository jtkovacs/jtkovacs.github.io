# 1. Decompositions of instructional skill

## 1.1. Booth's elements of instructional literacy

Per Booth (2011), core knowledge and skills for teaching (what she calls “instructional literacy”) includes:

- Capacity for **reflective practice** (not just after the fact, but primarily in the moment);
- Knowledge of **educational theory,** consisting of
    - **Learning theory** (how people learn)
    - **Instructional theory** (how to teach), and
    - **Curriculum theory** (content- and audience-specific considerations);
- Mastery of **teaching technologies** (for collaboration, assessment, etc.); and
- Integration and application of the prior three items, i.e. skill in **instructional design**




# 2. Movements and buzzwords

## 2.1. Critical pedagogy

## 2.2. Integrative learning

## 2.3. Problem-based learning

Per Stevens and Tieman (2017), the origin of PBL was contemporanous with critical pedagogy (Freire, Shore, books) but elsewhere---in McMaster's medical schools, spreading to libraries c. 1990s. They identify the following open questions in PBL, at least in the context of library instruction:

- How important is group work when it comes to problem-solving? Should groups report to the class?
- How much time, how many sessions, or what kind of timeline is required for PBL versus lectures?
- How much collaboration with instructors, to integrate course goals, content, or messaging re: library research?
- How much foundational instruction, versus 'thrown directly into the pool'?

While admitting that their own experience with PBL differed in important ways (e.g. they presented fairly tidy questions rather than "ill-structured problems"), they claim that PBL is only superficially aligned with critical pedagogy. They say that, despite rebranding teachers as facilitators/tutors/etc. who guide to small groups, in PBL the oppressive dichotomy (Freire) of student/teacher is left intact because "students are seen only as objects to control ... student are never seen as teachers").





# 3. Educational theory

## 3.1. How does educational theory draw on relevant sciences?

Per Keller (1983):

- **Behavioral psychology** --> feedback and reinforcement
- **Cognitive psychology** re: info processing --> "how to organize instruction" for "acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills"
    - "also studied in relation to individual differences in ability and learning style"
- [Motivation](#motivation-design) draws on

## 3.2. Keller's model of motivation, learning, and reinforcement

Keller (1983) writes practically on [motivation](#motivation-design) but he grounds it in his prior theoretical work. This work, in keeping with field theory/social learning theory, starts from the assumption that B, behavior is a function of E, the environment and P, the individual person, **B=f(E,P).** Then, as categories of behavior, Keller distinguishes between

- **Effort** = P's level of engagement and discipline, "a direct indicator of motivation" [jtk: I dispute this, because e.g. mental health];
- **Performance** = f(motivation/effort, ability, opportunity); and
- **Consequences** = performance + (benefits to the individual = reinforce motivation)

Determinants E and P may be examined for each behavior, identifying instructional strategies:

## 3.3. Qualities of excellent teachers

Per Booth (2011):

- [Logistics]
    - focus on goals
    - be organized enough to achieve them
- [Interpersonal]
    - be authentic
    - show your personal investment in the class and the students

## 3.4. Reflective practice

Per Booth (2011), a miscellany of advice regarding beliefs and attitudes:

- Be vigilant against the “curse of knowledge”, i.e. losing the ability to communicate with inexperts and to effectively anticipate knowledge gaps in one’s teaching









# 4. Instructional design

## 4.2. Motivation design

Per Keller (1983), motivation an extremely important part of learning; it is *why* people learn, rather than *how.*

A very important note: **optimal motivation is moderate motivation** (excess motivation is anxiety). This should be considered in motivational design, e.g. when setting the level of risk/reward (it should be moderate).

Keller's [theory of learning](#kellers-model-of-motivation-learning-and-reinforcement) and the underlying sciences imply that motivational design should address:

### 4.2.1. Interest

Interest = f(trait_curiosity,presentation); see [instructional messages.](#instructional-messages)

- ***Simulate curiosity*** = f(novelty, paradox, incongruity, complexity, abruptness, conflict)
    - Perceptual vs. *epistemic curiosity*
    - Trait vs. *state curiosity*
    - Note that curiosity can be fatigued by excessive stimulation
    - Appeal to emotions, personal experience, the familiar e.g. with analogies, metaphors, anecdotes, questions
- ***Sustain curiosity:***
    - Allowance to explore
    - Lower the cost of failure
    - Occasional surprises and humor
    - Make the familiar strange and vice versa
    - Separate convergent from divergent thinking (see [design thinking)](./strategy.html#design-thinking)
    - Use the **inquiry method** where students are given a genuine problem to solve, with the understanding that they are learning to navigate the process of inquiry

### 4.2.2. Relevance

Relevance = f(alignment, clear_connections). Drawing from *drive theory,* e.g. Maslow, Keller proposes a typology of personal (relevant to self) vs. instrumental (relevant to goals) vs. cultural (relevant to group)

- **Personal**
    - Promote a sense of **achievement** by combining "standards of excellence" with moderate risk and feedback that may be non-zero sum
    - Promote **empowerment** by allowing choice, responsibility, and influence
    - Promote **affiliation** by establishing trust, which may include non-zero sum grading
- **Instrumental** relevance can be made clear through learning objectives
- **Cultural** relevance is a matter of inclusive content, approaches, and environments, but also raises the question of whether a learner's culture places a high value on the type of education being offered

### 4.2.3. Expectancy

Expectancy = f(challenge, support), similar to "zone of proximal development"

- Address self-fulfilling prophecies of failure
- *[attribution theory/locus of control/personal causation/learned helplessness]*
    - Provide meaningful successes (not trivial small wins; learners know it won't transfer)
    - Make the pathway to success clear (mastery learning)
    - Give feedback that clarifies the connection between efforts and outcomes

### 4.2.4. Satisfaction

Satisfaction = f(intrinsic\_reinforcement, extrinsic\_reinforcement)

- To preserve intrinsic motivation (which can be destroyed by extrinsic reinforcement):
    - give "endogeneous" rewards that "customarily or naturally follows from a task"
    - give exogeneous rewards unexpectedly
- Give motivational feedback verbally and immediately
- Time informative/formative feedback (rather than evaluative/summative feedback) such that it is quickly actionable



## 4.3. Instructional messages

Booth (2011) summarizes Chip and Dan Heath’s best practices for powerful messages, which they organize as an acronym (SUCCESs) but I present here differently:

- get attention, hold interest: **UNEXPECTED, STORIES,** clearly relevant, clearly actionable
- facilitate comprehension: **SIMPLE, CONCRETE**
- appeal and persuade: **CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL**



## 4.4. Teaching technologies



## 4.5. Targets

Per Booth (2011), targets “allow you to structure measurable learning interactions” and “improve the impact of instruction, particularly when participants have had a hand in defining them”. Targets form a hierarchy:

- OUTCOMES = hoped-for lasting changes
- GOALS = express a theory of how to produce outcomes
- OBJECTIVES = strategies/skills needed to attain goals
